<h2><a name="A_Book_of_Bryn_Mawr_Stories" id="A_Book_of_Bryn_Mawr_Stories">A Book of Bryn Mawr Stories</a></h2>
<hr class="chap" />




<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface">Preface</a></h2>


<p>In compiling a volume of Bryn Mawr stories, the
editors have been conscious that such a book could
never adequately represent the college life. Its
strong subtle character that commands the devotion
of every Bryn Mawr student is something difficult
if not impossible to depict. Yet there comes a
time in the life of a college, as of an individual,
when self-expression is inevitable. Such a time,
the editors believe, has come for Bryn Mawr. And
this conviction has induced them to bring out the
present volume.</p>

<p>Until now the literary efforts of the students have
concerned themselves with external matters rather
than with introspection. Perhaps this is due to an
instinctive reticence we Bryn Mawrtyrs have wherever
our feelings are deeply stirred. We can joke
about ourselves and our traditions as we do in <i>The
Fortnightly Philistine</i>. But when we come to speak
seriously to the outside world, as in <i>The Lantern</i>,
we confine ourselves for the most part to subjects
of general literary interest, practically ignoring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
college atmosphere. At last, however, the ice is
broken, and Bryn Mawr talks about herself.</p>

<p>In the earliest days, when the college had only
two buildings and forty-four students, even in that
first year it had a character and a spirit all its own.
And fifteen years of rapid growth have seemed
but to strengthen its individuality. To show the
college unity in diversity the editors have carefully
chosen authors from the older and younger alumnæ
and from the undergraduates. They hope that in
this way a truer impression of the college life may
be given than would be possible if the whole book
were written by one person.</p>

<p>Some readers may ask which of the many
heroines in these tales is the typical Bryn Mawr
girl. The reply is no one, but all. Bryn Mawr
students come from all parts of the country, from
all sorts of different surroundings, and on entering
college they do not, popular prejudice to the contrary,
immediately drop their individuality and become
samples of a type. We have among our
number the pedant, the coquette, the athlete, the
snob, the poser, the girl who loves dress and prettiness,
and she who affects mannish simplicity,
the all-round girl, the serious-minded, and the
frivolous. Yet none of these is the Bryn Mawr
girl <i>par excellence</i>. That mythical personage can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
be known only by comparing and contrasting her
various incarnations.</p>

<p>This book is an attempt to show some of her
incarnations and some typical scenes of Bryn Mawr
life. College life is not dramatic and college stories
have no great dramatic interest, unless they introduce
elements foreign to the campus. Those who
look to these stories, therefore, for entertainment
may be disappointed, since most of them are serious
in tone, and in their appeal to the reader depend
largely upon the charm of local colour.</p>

<p>If in the mind of any one the spirit portrayed
in this book is unworthy, if it falls short of
the ideal of what college life should be, let it be
remembered that this is a first attempt, and let the
expression be blamed but not the Bryn Mawr spirit.</p>

<p>All of the following stories are new, and were
written for this book, except <i>Studies in College
Colour</i>, which are reprinted from <i>The Lantern</i> of
1893. One of these studies, the description of
Chapel, has appeared also in <i>Cap and Gown in
Prose</i>. For permission to use this last the editors
are indebted to the courtesy of Messrs. L. C. Page
&amp; Company.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>For the first time in many years Ellen Blake was
conscious of inability. Of course she could not
have expected that her good fortune would last forever.
And yet, it must be confessed, that her helplessness
coming, as it did, when she had every
reason to feel confident, had been altogether a surprise,
had, indeed, taken her at a cruel disadvantage.
She was the more disconcerted at finding herself
unable to do what she had promised when
she thought of the serious responsibility resting
upon her. It was wholly natural that she should
be looking at the predicament with the eye not of
an ordinary being but of a personage, whose failure
would be a public calamity,&mdash;no mere personal
misfortune. Intellectual distinction, natural eloquence,
and the personal charm that made her so
marked and attractive a figure, had brought her into
prominence as a leader among progressive women.
If she seemed inclined to take herself a trifle seriously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
no one could wonder, for the demands made upon
her were neither few nor slight. And while a
more selfish person might have shown a nice discrimination
in the choice of duties, Ellen, in her
gracious readiness to be of service, accepted as obligations
all the greatnesses thrust upon her. Constantly
importuned for utterances, she felt bound to
answer all requests for opinions, till at last, her
sense of humour grew weak in conflict with her
strenuousness, she had become an oracle on all
matters that were or ought to be of interest to
women. And so it happened that when she had
been asked to make a speech at the Women's Convention
in Indianapolis, on <i>The Educational Value
of College Life</i>, she had unhesitatingly consented.
But in this instance her fame and her conscience
had brought her face to face with failure, for on a
subject peculiarly suited to her, she could find no
words for feelings or ideas.</p>

<p>She was in despair, for not to make the speech
would be to play the traitor to the cause of Woman,
and to show the basest ingratitude to Bryn Mawr,
the place that had fitted her for her life work.
Taking herself to task had no effect. She wrote
some sentences, read them over, found them vague
and inaffective, gushing indeed. She continued to
write almost feverishly only to reject sheet after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
sheet. At length she decided that she had no exact
information, neither facts nor figures. That was
the trouble. In the discussion of so weighty a
matter both were important. Then, almost as an
inspiration, it seemed to her, came the thought of
Katherine Brewster, also a Bryn Mawrtyr, also interested
in woman.</p>

<p>"She is certainly just the person," said Ellen, and
she was soon standing on the Brewsters' doorstep.
A very systematic maid opened the door and
showed Ellen to a small room at the end of the hall.
Katherine's quarters had always met with her approval,&mdash;the
little room in which she waited, communicating
as she remembered with a larger room
beyond, had about it an air of business and privacy.
Though it had for seats only the stiffest of chairs,
and for reading matter only the dullest of reports,
Ellen's mood led her to envy the uncomfortable and
repellent atmosphere. By force of contrast it reminded
her of many miserable occasions, when she
had tried to feel at ease, while interviewing some
ardent reformer in the presence of her humourous
if sympathetic family.</p>

<p>She forgot for the time being, what she could not
but perceive in her less absorbed moments, that the
distinction and notoriety of Katherine was the distinction
and notoriety of the Brewster family; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
that, in sacrificing the general comfort to the convenience
of one, they were exchanging insignificance
for importance; while she, however conspicuous
personally, was also the daughter of Chief
Justice Blake, and was "the image of her mother,
the beautiful Polly Meredith." "Not so good-looking
though," sighed many an old gentleman,
as his thoughts reverted to the triumphs of that
beauteous maid in the days when girls broke hearts,
rather than conventions.</p>

<p>Wealth and social distinction, good-breeding and
beauty were hers without an effort, without a college
education; yet she knew well that there was
something in her that was due to Bryn Mawr. In
striving to express this she had come to Katherine
Brewster, sure that from her she would get the explanation.</p>

<p>She had hardly sat down before the door between
the rooms opened energetically and the brisk young
owner appeared, cheerful and businesslike in
manner.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ellen! How do you do? I shall be at
leisure," drawing out her watch and considering a
moment, "in six or seven minutes."</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer, Katherine turned
back to the other room. She left the door behind
her open and Ellen could not but see what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
going on. Her disused sense of the ridiculous
stirred slightly as she took in the details. Katherine
was talking, or rather giving facts, to a young man
who was dotting down her words in shorthand.
From the scraps of the conversation that reached
her, Ellen received a confused impression of myriads
of facts marshalled in excellent order. She congratulated
herself that she had indeed come to the
right person and would find valuable assistance in
the clear brain of Katherine Brewster.</p>

<p>At length she caught the words, "I have now
given you all the information at my command, and
shall trust you to make it interesting to the general
public and so prepare the way for our reform."
The young man could not linger in face of the
finality in her manner, and before he was well
out of the door Katherine had turned to her next
visitor with brief friendliness.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you, Ellen, and can just fit you
in between the Committee of Councils and the
reporter, who was anxious to get my opinion
on the new system for the disposal of garbage.
I should like to tell you all about it. It is so
absorbing."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I shall have to hold you down to
another subject. I need enlightenment as well as
the reporter. I have to tell the Women's Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the value of life in a woman's college. I was sure
this subject was one on which I was well informed,
till I came to think what I might say,&mdash;and lo! commonplaces
are all I can utter. I was at a loss what
to do,&mdash;loath to break my promise, and helpless in
my stupidity. Now, can't you give me an idea? I
hate to bother you, you are so busy. But it isn't
for myself only."</p>

<p>"Well, Ellen, I think I can help you," answered
Katherine with the utmost seriousness, "but you
will need pencil and paper," rising to get them, "or
suppose you sit here," sweeping aside the papers
littered over the desk and pointing to the chair in
front of it. "I shall have to deal in figures and you
might not remember them all."</p>

<p>Then followed a maze of numbers reeled off with
surprising readiness, now and then authenticated
by a glance at one of the many pigeon-holes. Ellen
felt somewhat dazed; but she was conscious that
the bewilderment was her contribution for the figures
were arranged with precision,&mdash;<i>Health of College
Women</i>, <i>Matrimonial Prospects of College
Women</i>, <i>The College Woman and the Problem of
Domestic Service</i>, <i>The Economic Results of College
training for Women</i>. Valuable facts were quoted
from them, facts bristling with suggestions for the
capable young woman so utterly mistress of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
but a trifle unmanageable for Ellen till she should
have time thoroughly to conquer them.</p>

<p>She was not altogether ungrateful when the servant
announced the Committee of Selectmen, and
she hastened to show her deference to the fathers of
the city by immediate withdrawal.</p>

<p>Katherine's good-bye took the form of advice, "I
should certainly deal with the practical value of college
life, taking up some line of thought that will
show its power to make women effective citizens in
the broad sense of the word."</p>

<p>There was no use in going directly home, for she
could make nothing of facts so dull, Ellen decided,
as she left the house. Besides she had no time to
get down to work. It was now four o'clock, and
she had promised to be at Edith Warrington's for
tea at five. She could go directly there; or, better
still, she might find Sara Ford and Augusta Coles at
home. Their flat was near by. They would be
sure to give her some ideas.</p>

<p>Sara was alone when Ellen reached their rooms,
and gave her a warm and ready welcome, of the
sort that tempted to friendly chat rather than to
weighty discussion. Sara was slight and frail in appearance,
and made an immediate appeal to most
persons by the wistful expression of her eyes. But
for all her seeming delicacy, she was full of nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
strength, and was besides very earnest, almost anxious
in her devotion to her duty and in her attitude
toward the responsibilities of a college woman.</p>

<p>There was in the room an effect of collision, of an
effort to combine the possessions of a gentle, ease-loving
nature, with those of one given overmuch to
austerity. The room itself, sunny and old-fashioned,
went far to reconcile the hostile elements, and the
result was inviting, if not harmonious.</p>

<p>Sara had settled Ellen comfortably on the broad
window-seat, and was solicitously tucking pillows
behind her back, apologizing the while for Augusta's
absence. "She has gone to see an authority on labor,"
Sara explained. "She wanted his opinion
on public ownership. She won't be gone long,
though."</p>

<p>"How does Augusta excite herself over such
questions?" wondered Ellen. Sara smiled absent-mindedly,
and then as though pondering, without a
shade of remonstrance in her manner, said, "Augusta
has the keenest insight into everyday subjects,
and the most wonderful grasp of them that I have
ever known. I never dare to be amused at Augusta.
I can do nothing but admire her. But now,
Nell," she continued, drawing her chair nearer the
window where Ellen was sitting, "tell me about
yourself. You are always doing interesting things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Certainly the world ought to be convinced of the
value of college education by the work of such
women as you and Augusta."</p>

<p>Ellen's mind was so firmly fixed on the object of
her visit that she was unembarrassed by the flattery
lavished upon her, and noted only the sympathy in
the words. When she had explained her difficulties
to Sara, she met with instant comprehension.</p>

<p>"Why, Nellie dear, I know just how you feel,"
was the prompt response to Ellen's statement.
"You are conscious of an overwhelming desire to
honour Bryn Mawr, of a responsibility to woman's
education, and you would not by a word injure the
one or retard the other."</p>

<p>"Of course, I feel that. But what am I going to
do? I've thought and thought till I haven't an idea
left. Katherine Brewster has loaded me down with
statistics, but I need something more. Can't you
give me a hint? There is so much of the picturesque
in the college life that is not at all frivolous, and yet
when I put pen to paper it is gone."</p>

<p>"I am always conscious of just that state of
mind," assented Sara, "when I try to express my
feeling about college. The beauty of the place, the
glamour over everything! One can't describe it."</p>

<p>It was becoming evident to Ellen that Sara was
but echoing her own words, was giving sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
rather than advice. She had just made up her mind
to be off, when the door opened to admit Sara's
room-mate.</p>

<p>A cursory, modern greeting was all that Augusta
Barneson Coles vouchsafed her visitor.</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do for you?" asked Augusta,
drawing off her gloves, and with the greatest
precision pulling out the fingers. When she had
finished this operation she laid the gloves on the
table. Augusta maintained, against all comers, that
neatness alone was to be considered in dress, and
showed herself consistent by appearing at a formal
dinner party in an immaculate shirt waist and short
skirt. In the obtrusive simplicity of the shapeless
coat, the uncompromising hat, the well-hung but
skimped skirt, the severely arranged tie, the colourless
hair smoothed in defiance of the wind, the stout
shoes and correct stockings, you perceived the care of
one who had a character to preserve.</p>

<p>Ellen straightened herself and assumed a thrifty
exactness in her speech, setting aside preamble and
apology; for in talk with Augusta she felt that the
amenities of life were worse than wasted, they
were insulting.</p>

<p>"Yes, Augusta, tell me what you can say for
women's colleges, as distinguished from other
modes of training."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"They will redeem the world from its present
deplorable condition by teaching women to live by
ideas," was the succinct if sweeping assertion.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I don't understand," murmured
Ellen.</p>

<p>"By removing them from the sordid pressure of
the practical," Augusta went on, "and that at a
critical period in the mind's development and bringing
them into an atmosphere of pure ideas, till the
concrete no longer exists for them."</p>

<p>This statement seemed somewhat nonsensical to
Ellen, but she had come for information and persisted.
"That's all very well, but to make it more
personal. I can't express what my college education
has meant to me. What has it meant to you?"</p>

<p>"Experience meetings of any sort are distasteful
to me," answered Augusta brusquely, "they make
impossible abstract thought and result in commonplaces
of undisciplined sentiment. They bend the
idea to the individual, not the individual to the
idea."</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Augusta had given all
that was in her power and that Ellen would only
lose time by urging her to closer definition. So far
she had received opinions almost irreconcilable one
with the other, the practical views of Katherine and
the abstractions of Augusta. She was indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
amused rather than disappointed at the failure of
her visit. How absurd she had been to expect
fertile suggestions from Sara, always ready to reflect
the mood of her companion&mdash;a quality often
soothing and endearing but hardly useful in moments
of perplexity;&mdash;or from Augusta with her
futile theories and ridiculous jargon.</p>

<p>She had still one hope, Bertha Christie, who had
gathered about her a group of Bryn Mawr graduates,
all anxious to indulge the scholastic passion.
Research and literature occupied them for the most
part; but, in the intervals of study, they cultivated
self-consciousness and held dress-rehearsals that
they might perfect themselves in the parts selected.
Phrase-making was their pastime and tricks of face
and manner their delight. Their duty to themselves
led them to withdraw from their families,
thus liberating themselves from the exigencies of an
unappreciative society. So sedulous were these
artists in life to free themselves from tyranny to
the individual that they regarded all outside demands
as impertinent intrusions. They courted
criticism and experience and craved æsthetic satisfaction.</p>

<p>The only one of the band at home when Ellen
was shown in, was Bertha Christie. Had she been
seen in the midst of commonplace surroundings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
dressed in a less studied fashion, she would in all
likelihood have passed unnoticed. But the clinging
folds of her dress, exquisite in colour and texture, the
deliberately loosened hair, the poise of the head, and
the languid grace of motion as she moved forward
to greet Ellen, suggested something of the romantic,
something of the ascetic, with just a seasoning of
coquetry. She had the artistic temperament, but
abilities critical rather than creative. She read
poetry but measured life by her intellect. Hers was
a disposition susceptible to impressions, but cruel
in the analysis of them.</p>

<p>Her expression of indifference became one of
scornful amusement as she listened to Ellen's
earnest setting forth of her errand. A skilled
fencer in words she succeeded in parrying the
insistent queries, without revealing the triviality
of her ideas. The impression left on Ellen's mind
by this conversation was really disturbing. Up to
this point she had no doubts about the value of
college life, but now she wondered if there were
not more to be said against it than for it. Was it
not responsible for the selfishness and affectation of
Bertha Christie? She looked at the clock on a
near-by steeple and saw that she was already late
for her engagement with Edith. In her annoyance
at her wasted effort she was not sorry to think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
at her next stopping-place she might dismiss business
from her thoughts and enjoy the consolation
and diversion she was sure to find.</p>

<p>It was significant of her attitude that, although
she had meant all along to drop in on Edith, on her
way home, and knew besides that she was certain
to find one or two more of her college friends, she
had no thought of them in connection with her
speech. She had unconsciously drifted into imagining,
as did all outsiders, that Augusta Coles and
Bertha Christie were the types and her own friends
the anomalies among college women. Her friendships
and her activities were no longer brought into
contact. So long as Ellen was looking for companionship,
she still showed herself capable of appreciating
wisdom as well as cleverness, good sense
as well as originality; but just so soon as she desired
enlightenment, she forgot that her own
friends might hold opinions worthy of consideration,
and singled out the eccentric or visionary
among her acquaintances. In doing so she was
not consciously seeking singularity, she was rather
showing her instinctive reverence for experience.
Having become something of a doctrinaire, she
went for her instruction to those more advanced
than herself.</p>

<p>Had Edith Warrington been true to what seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
to Ellen the best in her, she might have been set
among the sages, but Edith had voluntarily forfeited
all right to be considered really earnest, for
after she had determined to devote her life to study,
she had been turned aside by a mere trifle. In the
second year of her post-graduate study, she had
had a call from an old lady whom she had always
found most entertaining and had been bored with
the random gossip so delightful hitherto.</p>

<p>"It's the last straw," she said, in talking to one
of her friends of the occurrence, "when Mrs. Astruther
bores me there's something the matter.
I've noticed an indifference to everything but my
work growing upon me of late, but have ignored
it. This shock has brought me to my senses and
shows me that I prefer people to things." She was
urged not to generalize too hastily, by the friends
who were eager to see her fulfil her promise as a
scholar. She had now been married about five
years, and, because the memory of her scholarship
was still fresh, she was spoken of as one lost past
recovery; for, though she never lost her student
ways, she was no longer called a student.</p>

<p>When Ellen came within sight of the house, she
heard some one tap on the pane and on looking up
saw Edith signalling to her not to ring.</p>

<p>"Here you are at last, Nell," was her greeting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
"I was looking for you. What kept you so late?
Some old committee?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm dead tired. I have had a miserable
afternoon."</p>

<p>"You poor thing! Come along and be amused.
Louise and Evelyn are here. They're having a
heated discussion about matrimony. It's a bit personal
and very funny."</p>

<p>"Louise and Evelyn? It must be absurd."</p>

<p>"Yes, they think they're talking on broad general
principles, but they're just talking about Dick
Fisher and Mr. Brandon."</p>

<p>"You know him?" asked Ellen. "I've never
met him and since Evelyn's engagement was announced
I've been curious about him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he is a very nice fellow&mdash;really charming."</p>

<p>"But not good enough for Evelyn, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"They never are, are they, Nell?" and Edith
turned with an amused smile.</p>

<p>"No, not even Mr. Warrington," laughed Ellen.
"I don't agree about him yet."</p>

<p>When they reached the little study, Ellen nodded
to the two girls sitting near the window and flung
herself into an easy chair by the tea table, glad to
rest her mind with a counter distraction. She knew
the disputants well and felt as much at home with
them as with Edith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Louise Fisher had been her room-mate at college,
distinguished for her common sense and independent
ways and a warm advocate of the business
career for women, all women married or single.
Many a satirical picture had Ellen drawn in those
days, of Louise's ideal of domestic happiness. But
Louise had become engaged before she graduated,
to a man immeasurably her superior in mental
ability, and she had settled down to echoing his
opinions. Ellen often wondered if no ghosts
sat opposite to Louise at the breakfast table;
but she could not disturb her by any amount of
banter.</p>

<p>Evelyn Ames, the other disputant, had been an
enigma at college. She had attracted many on first
acquaintance; but had baffled them at the point
where acquaintance ripens into intimacy. No one
dared call herself Evelyn's friend, except such as
were content with the formal graciousness of her
ways. And yet she had been a force in college life,
had shown both courage and enthusiasm at critical
moments.</p>

<p>She had recently announced her engagement, and
was naïve in her disclosures of her own feelings in
the present discussion. She was thoroughly at her
ease with her companions; for since she had left
college, she had surprised many, whom she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
before held at a distance, into very real friendships,
taking them unawares by her affection for Bryn
Mawr and its associations. These three had discovered
that her inaptitude for fellowship at college
was the result of a former starvation of her affections.
The daughter of a widow, a woman of
small means, of cold nature and social ambition,
Evelyn had not been allowed to find out the softer
side of her nature, till she had been sent to Bryn
Mawr by a rich and domineering relative.</p>

<p>When Edith and Ellen joined them, Louise was
saying, "The only way is to try to divert his mind
from his work."</p>

<p>"But that doesn't seem to me at all the nicest
way," said Evelyn. "I think you ought to be able
to help a man in his work."</p>

<p>"At that rate," said Edith, as she poured out a
cup of tea, "Ellen should marry a public man and
help him write his&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," sniffed Louise contemptuously, "like
Mrs. Jones, Dick says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Nell," and Evelyn turned quickly to Ellen,
"somebody told me about the speech you're to
make. What a splendid chance you've got."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," answered Ellen, "it's
the hardest thing I ever had to do. I can't for the
life of me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"But just think," interrupted Evelyn, "it means
Bryn Mawr. That's what we think of when we
think of college. Oh! I wish I could just for once
say what I think of the dear place. But I never can
talk about it in a sensible way."</p>

<p>"Just as well," put in Edith, "it's one of the
things it doesn't pay to be sensible about."</p>

<p>"Edith, what do you mean?" interjected Louise,
"when you speak in public you can't talk twaddle.
Dick says, common sense is the only thing that holds
people."</p>

<p>"He's faithful to his opinions anyway," answered
Edith with a friendly nod, "you've just as much as
ever."</p>

<p>"But, Nell," asked Evelyn, leaning forward in her
interest, "what are you going to say?"</p>

<p>"That's what I don't know. I've gone from pillar
to post trying to find out and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No wonder you're weary," said Edith, "wasting
your time that way. Why on earth didn't you
ask us? Please tell us where you did go."</p>

<p>"Oh, to several places," answered Ellen evasively.
"I never thought of bothering you people, you have
so many outside things to attend to."</p>

<p>"Yes to be sure, husbands and children and all
the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know that isn't what I mean," objected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Ellen, setting down her teacup. "You always say
you aren't interested in movements."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" corrected Edith, "not movements."&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, anyway I didn't succeed with the other
people. 'College training fits us to be citizens';
'college teaches us to live by ideas'; 'college is of
value to none but those gifted with a susceptibility
for the exquisite refinements of the intellectual existence.'
What am I to do with that?"</p>

<p>Edith and Evelyn exchanged amused glances,
while Louise looked scornful. Ellen continued,
"I have to think how my words will affect
Bryn Mawr, and also how they will strike my
audience."</p>

<p>"Don't forget yourself," said Edith. "You've
a way of leaving a bit of yourself behind when you
get to work."</p>

<p>"Oh, it will come to you, don't fear," broke in
Evelyn. "You do all that sort of thing so well,
you'll be sure to make a hit. You couldn't help it
talking about Bryn Mawr. If only I could do it.
My four years there made life worth living."</p>

<p>"Come now, Evelyn," said Edith teasingly, "it
will never do for you to say things like that, and
you just engaged. Please think of poor Mr.
Brandon. He'll get to hate Bryn Mawr, and I
won't blame him a scrap. You must&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"That has nothing to do with it," protested
Evelyn, looking embarrassed, "but I know nothing
could have been at all as it is if I hadn't gone there.
With me the trouble wasn't so much a dearth of
resources as a lack of opportunity for devotion.
When I got to college I found that the thing demanded
of me was devotion to Bryn Mawr. Every
one expected it and I gave myself up to serving the
first thing that needed me."</p>

<p>"But that wasn't anything in Bryn Mawr," objected
Louise, "that was you."</p>

<p>"Don't you think," interposed Edith, "that the
personal romance of our lives takes the place of all
impersonal romance of that sort in time?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," assented Evelyn slowly, "but it is
the one romance that hasn't to rub up against realities.
We lived there in a world of our own creation&mdash;a
land of dreams. Our dreams for Bryn
Mawr may always be realized; they are never
shown to be impossible."</p>

<p>"Well, really," exclaimed Louise, "you seem to
be getting very high falutin, all of you. My feeling
about college is that if it hadn't been for my friends
it would have been a hateful place&mdash;all hard work
and nothing else. It's the friendships you make
there that count."</p>

<p>"To be sure they count," said Edith, "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
you might say the same of boarding-school. I
know what it is. It's the student government."</p>

<p>"Now just listen to that," cried Ellen, "you're
as bad as other people, you don't agree at all. You,
Edith, talk of self-government, but that isn't
general. And I can't tie myself down to Bryn
Mawr. We all think Bryn Mawr the best of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Twenty years hence this weather<br /></span>
<span class="i3">May tempt us from office stools;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We may be slow on the feather,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And seem to the boys old fools.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But we'll still swing together<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And swear by the best of schools,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>sang a merry voice in the doorway and with one
accord the girls sprang to their feet to welcome the
singer. But she continued serenely,&mdash;"The same
idea may be found in the lines of another well-known
song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'When the cares of life o'ertake us&mdash;'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last lines were lost in the vehemence with
which Ellen and Edith greeted the newcomer.</p>

<p>"You piece of absurdity," urged Edith impatiently,
"stop your mimicry and tell us how you
got here."</p>

<p>"Without adventure, my excitable Edith, till I
came upon this strange gathering, perhaps the
strangest gathering ever known to the scientist,&mdash;for
as Leuwenhoek says&mdash;&mdash;" The change of voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
in the last words, and the immediate response from
her listeners showed a traditional joke. But she
went on immediately, "I'm on my way to Bryn
Mawr and I dropped in to remind you that you've
all promised to bear me company. I was afraid
you might forget. A trip there from Philadelphia
is less of an undertaking than one from Emmonsville,
Montana. And I'm going to pass the night
with you, fair Ellen. I wrote to you warning you
of my intention about two weeks ago. My trunk
is already at your house, and I have been there; but
was sent to bring you home. Your mother was
afraid you would forget you were to dine with
Mrs. Boughton and help her with a Dean or a
Bishop,&mdash;something architectural and impressive."</p>

<p>"I had forgotten all about it and I haven't a
minute to lose," said Ellen, as she and Marjorie
hurried off amid the protests of the others.</p>

<p>Ellen begged Marjorie to come upstairs with
her and amuse her while she dressed; but Marjorie
refused to talk, insisting on hearing all about Ellen's
visits of the afternoon. She passed her comment
on the characters in the narrative, comment
genial, friendly, sympathetic, till Ellen came to
Bertha Christie's part. On a sudden Marjorie's
indignation blazed out.</p>

<p>"Ellen, is it that you have failed to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Bryn Mawr, or that you have willfully misunderstood?
You have accepted the judgment of the
outside world and have treated those freaks as
representatives of Bryn Mawr. Have you forgotten
how they were ignored, jeered at, anything but
accepted by everybody but a few freshmen? They
defied college spirit, mocked at common sense and
still do. And the world sets them down as types!
Bertha Christie with her menagerie of intimates intolerant
of the commonplace! I could pity them if
people like you didn't make them of so much importance."</p>

<p>"Intolerant, maybe I am," in answer to a feeble
protest from Ellen, "I'm rather proud of being intolerant
of a set of sophisticated hermit-crabs, a
few puling nuns who've gone to school to the
melancholy Jacques. No wonder I hear queer
things about Bryn Mawr when you go to them for
ideas and pass by Edith and Evelyn and a host
of others. It's enough to make one turn cynic.
Tolerance! Tolerance of evil, breadth of mind it
calls itself, is the most discouraging thing I meet
with. And yet how absurd it all is. You, so well-balanced,
so lofty in your aims, going to those
geese to learn wisdom&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're not geese," protested Ellen at length,
"they're unusually clever girls."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"'A goose,' please remember," quoted Marjorie,
regaining her temper with the reassertion of her
sense of humour, "is none the less a goose, though
sun and stars be minced to yield him stuffing!
You'd better be off or you'll have to apologize to
the Bishop for keeping him from his dinner."</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Greatly to her astonishment Ellen found that she
had fallen to the Bishop's care at dinner. She was
not, however, easily appalled by distinguished people,
and she chatted lightly to the stranger. His
beautiful face, benignant and merry, set her completely
at her ease,&mdash;the secure ease of the American
woman, it seemed to him as he made mental notes
of the effect produced by the exquisite dress, the
vivacity and readiness, the almost boyish frankness,
the worldly wisdom. And all the time he wondered
why there recurred to him the thought of a
serious nature, an intellectual nature, free from
worldliness and triviality.</p>

<p>Ellen was giving herself up to the enjoyment of
the moment, giving her best to a listener so responsive
and stimulating and she was all the more
ready to do so because of the concentrated thought
of the day. But she was not to escape for long,
for she heard her companion say, "You have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
a student at Bryn Mawr, they tell me, Miss Blake,
and I have been greatly interested in hearing so;
for I think it a most lovely spot, quite an ideal sort
of place. Its airs of age are very clever too, very
deceptive. It impressed me as an old place. An
almost reverential feeling stirred me, so marked
was the sense of dignity. It is in a word academic.
Everywhere one may see that bewildering mixture
of history and aspiration."</p>

<p>"We can't help feeling a little proud that after
so few years of existence it should begin to be impressive
as well as beautiful," said Ellen, who
hardly welcomed the return to the subject that had
engrossed her thoughts so long, though she could
not resist the enthusiasm of one familiar with the
English universities.</p>

<p>"Of course, in this country one never wonders
at rapidity of growth, but I must confess that
æsthetic charm does not always accompany it.
That delightful president of yours has secured both."</p>

<p>"She is a worker of wonders. She has plans
for the place now that exceed all our dreams."</p>

<p>"Of course years may mellow the ugliest spot
and association endear it, but after all 'virtue is
loveliest in lovely guise.' The gift of beauty is not
to be despised. Even the most casual visitor must
acknowledge a spell in that college of yours altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
independent of the mysterious charm that
you who know it intimately find for yourselves,&mdash;to
some degree what I am sure people would find in
my own university were they to go there ignorant
of its wealth of history. But they are outsiders,"
he continued musingly, almost as though he had
forgotten the existence of the girl to whom he was
talking, "they see only the outward show, they
are forever shut out from a share in that spirit that
is the immortal part of the university, that persists
in spite of change."</p>

<p>The old man's memories awoke at these words,
and in his reminiscences he unfolded for Ellen picture
after picture of that old world school, and flattered
her with a sight of the thing her Alma Mater
might become. For she listened to tales that made
distant things seem real and present to her, stories
of the frailties of men whose names had been beacons
to her intellect. Her emotions were stirred by
the tender humour that summoned up for her the
personalities that had touched his own boyhood,
and had left their impress on the life of Oxford.</p>

<p>The bishop's attention was challenged by a gentleman
across the table with a question on South
Africa, and for the rest of the evening Ellen shared
her friend with the other guests.</p>

<p>Before she left she found a chance to tell Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Boughton how delightful her companion had been.
"Well, Ellen, to be candid," with an indulgent
smile at the girl whom she liked in spite of her
brains, "I should not have honoured you so much
had he not asked to have you for a neighbour. But
you needn't lay the credit to your attractions. I
was running over the people he would meet this
evening and when I came to you, that he might not
expect an angel, I mentioned your only faults,&mdash;that
you had been to college and spelled woman
with a large W. But I told him that as a rule you
kept these peculiarities in the background. However
it was your having been to college that interested
him, for he wanted to see what sort of
women Bryn Mawr turned out. Of course I told
him he couldn't judge by you&mdash;you were an exception&mdash;that
he would have to see a few specimens
like your friend Miss Christie or Augusta Barneson
Coles."</p>

<p>As she drove home Ellen's thoughts turned to
Marjorie Heywood and her plans for the next day.
The talk at dinner had decided Ellen to go with
the others. Though she lived so near, she found
little pleasure in going out to Bryn Mawr nowadays,
for everything seemed changed and she felt nothing
but resentment that the past should have been so
easily forgotten, its ways so quickly superseded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Her careless reading of Marjorie's letter had made
her arrival a surprise, and Ellen experienced a sense
of relief at Marjorie's appearance. Her relief
showed how apprehensive she had been of the
changes possible in ten years' time, and above all
in a ten years so trying as those that Marjorie had
passed through. Just when she had seemed well
started in her chosen work she had had to give up
everything and care for a worthless brother. She
had had to fight poverty for herself and him, and
for him disease and evil. The cheerful letters that
had come to Ellen now and then, had brought her
little satisfaction, they were so impersonal. It had
been in vain that Edith reminded her that Marjorie
had always been impersonal, reticent. Putting herself
into everything she did and said was her way
of talking about herself. It had been in vain too
that Edith contended that Marjorie's enthusiasm for
righteousness and humorous freshness of mind
were her safeguard against old age. "Marjorie
will be just the same," she maintained, "when she
is a hundred years old." To-night for the first
time, Ellen believed her. Ten years! Could it be
ten years? And Marjorie still the same, the old
spirit of raillery gleaming in her eyes, the irresistible
quiver at the corners of the mouth?</p>

<p>Ellen found her mother and Marjorie in the full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
swing of a good talk. They had been linked in
their sympathetic understanding of one another
since early in freshman year, when Marjorie had
spent a Sunday with Ellen. And to-night they had
no remembrance of the interval that had passed
since they had last been together. Ellen longed to
throw herself into one of the easy chairs and share
in the ardour of conversation; but she remembered
her speech.</p>

<p>"If I am to fall in with your plan, and I am
afraid I am too weak to defy your indomitable
will, I must write that wretched speech to-night. I
don't dare trust myself to write it at Bryn Mawr
with you to beguile me," was her answer to
Marjorie's entreaties that she should stop and tell
them all about her evening.</p>

<p>"Oh, sit up all night, if you'll get to Bryn Mawr
by doing it," answered Marjorie with a nod to Mrs.
Blake who was about to remonstrate. "I'll assist
you by the subtle influence of my presence and
read the while.</p>

<p>"What do I want to read? Oh, anything at all,
thank you, Mrs. Blake,&mdash;something that will keep
me from interrupting Ellen. Yes, that's just the
thing," and she took the book that Mrs. Blake
handed her and started upstairs.</p>

<p>As the girls reached the room Ellen said, "I've a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
good mind to give the whole thing up. I'm perfectly
hopeless about it."</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," asserted
Marjorie. "You'll just sit down there and write."</p>

<p>"It will be a perfunctory business at that rate,"
objected Ellen, "I don't feel as though I could write
a word."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," retorted Marjorie, "but just
see that you get through with it to-night. A body
can't get any good of you with it on your mind.
And that's one of the things I came on for."</p>

<p>With that Marjorie opened her book and Ellen sat
down to her task. It went slowly at first. She
wrote little and that with constant reference to her
notes. But after a time she seemed to find the
thoughts coming more quickly.</p>

<p>Marjorie's book did not seem to hold her attention.
Her thoughts seemed borne beyond it, and
her eyes wandered about the room, noting the restfulness
of the golden brown on the walls, the preponderance
of etchings&mdash;landscapes for the most
part&mdash;the low bookcase stretching the full length
of the wall, the ornaments, obviously the choice
of one more susceptible to form than to colour.
There was in the room nothing brilliant, nothing
conspicuous. Taking in the details, her glance
came at length to rest on Ellen herself as she bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
over the old-fashioned desk. She was turned so
that Marjorie could see a little more than her profile.
And Marjorie's expression was one of affectionate
amusement as she watched the serious, almost stern
lines of the face, the gravity in the eyes, when they
were occasionally raised.</p>

<p>For some time Marjorie observed her closely and
then broke in upon the silence with,&mdash;"I'm drifting
irresistibly to conversation or drowsiness, I
don't know which, but in any case I'd much better
away to bed. So good-night and good luck."</p>

<p>Then just as she reached the door she turned
laughingly to Ellen and said, "Your hair is just as
nice as ever; but I'm afraid you've got the world
tied to your little finger."</p>

<p>But Ellen merely nodded and smiled at the sound
of Marjorie's voice, not hearing one word of the
taunt.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Marjorie had had her way and the five friends
were now spending the last day of their visit to
Bryn Mawr, as they had spent the others, picking
up old threads and discovering new ones.</p>

<p>The changes since their day were many and to
Marjorie, seeing them for the first time, they
seemed like personal affronts, rousing in her that
passion of resentment which is the lunacy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
graduate. The old gate was done away with.
The old road no longer existed. A long stretch of
buildings struck her eye unfamiliarly. Taylor had
shrunk itself among the trees and its dear ugliness
was retired from the gaze of approaching visitors.
But the alterations were so skillful that the alumnæ
soon felt an admiring ownership in them and
quickly embraced the changes.</p>

<p>Almost the only familiar figures to be seen were
those of college servants there since the beginning,
one of whom, William, once well-nigh universal
in his activities, was now so highly differentiated
that he seemed to do nothing but carry the mails.
He was a repository of traditions, and he delighted
forlorn alumnæ by his air of proprietorship in
the past as well as in the present. Small wonder
that, when they found their doings sunk into a
mere tradition and marked the shortness of memory
and self-importance of the undergraduates,
they turned for cheer to William's flattery and refused
to consider its ambiguities.</p>

<p>"No, no, miss, none of our young ladies now
are like the young ladies when you were here.
In your time they certainly was young ladies.</p>

<p>"And your name, miss? It's the same I suppose,
I'm afraid to call any of you by name,
there's so many married, you see, and they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
be offended if I didn't remember the gentleman's
name, you see. I keep track of you all by reading
the list of names and who's dead and married.
Talking of marriages, miss, so Dr. &mdash;&mdash; is
married. Well, he's the last of our professors
I'd a thought of marrying. Well, changes is
changes, miss, when all's said and done."</p>

<p>On this their last afternoon, Susan Everett and
Beatrice O'Hara had joined the five where they
were sitting under the cherry tree in front of
Taylor. Their talk was of the undergraduates
and the zest with which they listened to tales
of those first days.</p>

<p>"Their seeming disregard of us and our doings
is the result of ignorance, not of indifference,"
Edith was saying, "but their curiosity is now
thoroughly aroused."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes indeed," groaned Marjorie, "they've
decided they'll collect the traditions and if you've
the age of Methuselah and the memory of Macaulay,
they wind you up and you can be doing
nothing at all but telling them stories. And
you've to stop and explain to them who the
Polyglot is and the Gifted, and even I can't quite
make clear to them those treasures of individuality.
All you get for your pains is, 'Oh yes! one of the
professors.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Her plaint seemed to be justified, for across
from Pembroke some girls came running and
when they saw the group under the tree, one
of them called out,&mdash;"Oh, here you are, Miss
Heywood! May we not come and learn some
more history?"</p>

<p>And as though Marjorie's consent were a foregone
conclusion, they sat down on the grass
at her feet and settled themselves as children
will for the treat in store.</p>

<p>"Come, Tommie, tell us a story and play the
fool for us, as you used to do," said Susan
Everett lapsing into the old name and desirous
that Marjorie should assume her old character.</p>

<p>"I should have drifted naturally into my accustomed
rôle, had you kept still a moment;
but introductory remarks are death to spontaneity.
And, like Amanda Jones, I want my little
fun spontaneous.</p>

<p>"Now, you never knew Amanda Jones," she continued
to the undergraduates, "but by that historic
utterance she deprived you of a custom. Did you
ever think why you never had a class-day at Bryn
Mawr? You know you never have had one, and
if you ever do the ghost of Amanda Jones will
haunt the campus.</p>

<p>"It was the year we graduated, and we," indicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
her companions, "had been sitting up into the
small hours arranging for a class-day. The first
class had gone out in solemn dignity, but we craved
something more; we would have a class-day. We
had an elaborate program made out, amusing, but
academic, without doubt the cleverest entertainment
that has ever been or ever will be. We had
written an inimitable parody of the <i>Clouds</i>,&mdash;so
funny, so much funnier than anything Aristophanes
ever did. Humour so subtle was never heard.
We couldn't read it ourselves without weeping
with laughter. Well, the parts were assigned,
the costumes half made, the invitations sent out,
when of a sudden a class meeting was called at
Amanda's request. As soon as preliminaries were
over she arose, made a telling arraignment of class-day,
referred touchingly to former graduations at
Bryn Mawr, and then she, who had never even gone
to an entertainment, much less invented one, paused
dramatically, and slowly enunciated, 'we've always
had our little fun spontaneous!' She carried the
day, and still carries it, and there is no such thing as
class-day at Bryn Mawr."</p>

<p>"Amanda wasn't about when we were practicing
for our comb-orchestra," laughed Beatrice. "Poor
Amanda! She didn't know that the deliberations
beforehand were half the fun."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you remember," asked Ellen, "the evening
we spent sitting in the trunk-room in Merion, helping
Alice Marston write the <i>Professor</i>?"</p>

<p>"Dear me, I had forgotten," sighed Louise, "and
I don't think anything has ever seemed really funny
since that."</p>

<p>"The sad part of it is," continued Evelyn, "that
the warning in the motto we used would now be a
necessity. Who but ourselves would understand
those jokes? What was the motto?" to an inquiring
freshman,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quae jocum suspiciet, eam oportet ridere;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Quae non, oportet aliis ridentibus ridere.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Ne lacrima!<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Quot intellixistis?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Don't apologize for talking Latin, Evelyn," said
Marjorie, with a comical glance at the group, "it's
like our mother tongue."</p>

<p>"That was the way the Latin lecture used to begin,"
explained Ellen, for the benefit of the undergraduates.
"You see we used to have lectures
in Latin as a sort of elective."</p>

<p>"That sounds impressive; it did to me when I
first heard it," responded Marjorie, "but those Latin
lectures were the most humorous things you could
imagine. You watched the Polyglot's face, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
knew when to laugh and when to weep, and you
were a little dull if you didn't understand enough to
raise your hand when he called out 'Quot intellixistis?'</p>

<p>"Do you remember the one on Irish bulls? In
your honour wasn't it, Pat?" turning to Beatrice
O'Hara, whose vaunted Irish blood was evident in
her speech.</p>

<p>"I wish I'd kept a record of Pat's bulls," remarked
Susan. "I often feel as though one of them was
just the tonic I needed."</p>

<p>"Never mind," answered Beatrice, good-humouredly,
"I once saw through one all by myself. That
time I told you I was carrying a stool with me because
I had to stand up."</p>

<p>"I often think of the way the Gifted chuckled,
because you would say 'whenever a man died,'"
added Ellen.</p>

<p>"I didn't deserve his ridicule; for I was the only
person capable of understanding what he meant by
his favourite 'on a mutual hand,' or of appreciating
the beautiful idea of his 'tell all that you don't
know about this subject.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, Marjorie," exclaimed Edith, "have you forgotten
how you disgraced yourself just because you
thought you noticed the joke introducing expression
on a learned lecturer's face? You would go to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
German lecture on Ulfilas, thinking it wise to make
the most of all opportunities for getting up your
German for your orals."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," interrupted Marjorie, "I came
to myself to find the distinguished guests and the
members of the Faculty gazing at me as though I
were crazy, and you pinching me black and
blue. And all because I had worked myself into
hysterics of laughter over the Lord's Prayer in
Gothic."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it queer in those days when everything
was new?" inquired one of the audience.</p>

<p>"My dear child there never was a time when
everything was new, and I know what I'm talking
about, for I was the first freshman that ever spent
a night in Bryn Mawr, and I then learned that Bryn
Mawr already had a history that was venerable,
customs that were inviolable. That first night I
learned the Manus Bryn Mawrensium and the Maid
of Bryn Mawr. I was early taught the tradition of
the sacredness of the Harriton family cemetery,
taken there by two sponsors, who felt the necessity
of impressing us, the newcomers, with the past.</p>

<p>"In that stretch of woodland," here her voice
took on a sentimental tone, "known as the Vaux
woods, and still frequented by Bryn Mawr
students, there lies nestling among the trees a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
secluded burying ground. Grey walls of ancient
date bound it within narrow compass. The masonry
sturdily defiant of time, has been mellowed
by a growth of moss and lichen. To any eye a
picturesque spot! In its calm but cheerful solitude,
no inhospitable resting-place! You feel in a sense
possessors of that place; you are aware that in
some subtle manner it belongs to you; but fully to
comprehend your own feelings you must hear the
droll, though sentimental reminiscence of the first
class of Bryn Mawr; you must picture to yourselves
a group of students on the worn steps and
the nervous, enthusiastic figure of that 'learned doctor,'
as he walks up and down in front of them,
declaiming ore rotundo and with all possible expression,
the parting of Hector and Andromache.
Yes, he taught us Horace," answering a question
from one of the groups on the grass. "Oh, you
have no such classes now. I couldn't imagine college
without his Horace class."</p>

<p>"How we had to work in it, though," sighed
Louise.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, but you know we always had his permission
to shirk all other work that we might do
his," came from Beatrice.</p>

<p>"And at last we had to protest," continued
Edith. "Had we done all that was expected of us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
we should never have gone to bed. Our protests
passed seemingly unheeded, till one day just before
Thanksgiving, the Polyglot entered the room, one
shoulder heaved on high with the great pile of
books he held under his arm. Having as usual begun
his lecture in the corridor, he was saying as he
came inside the door, 'I have with me a most interesting
find, a manuscript Latin poem, unexpectedly
come into my possession. I shall write it on
the board and then ask some one to volunteer with
a translation.' Then standing on tiptoe, at times
jumping so that he might write at the very top of
the blackboard, he began to copy some verses, but
long before he had finished, the class was convulsed
with laughter. For it was a graceful little
apology for overworking us."</p>

<p>"When I think of Bryn Mawr," said Marjorie,
"few things have left so vivid an impression on my
mind as his class-room. I was under the spell of
literature from the moment I heard him give out his
first parallel passage. There was in his classes a
magical exhilaration never to be forgotten. And
to think you poor things don't know anything
about it!</p>

<p>"It must seem very different to you now," put
in a senior, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"To be sure it does, and I think nothing strikes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
me more than the light-hearted way in which you
do things that we didn't dare to do for fear of
bringing down rules on our heads. Like our ancestors
we were constantly 'snuffing tyranny.'"</p>

<p>"Hadn't you self-government then?" asked a
freshman in amazement.</p>

<p>"We had no government of any sort, and no
despotism could have been more compelling than
the nameless fear that hung over us, that we might
some day do something that would lead some one
to take away our liberty."</p>

<p>"I have always regretted the establishment of
self-government," said Elizabeth Gordon, a graduate
who was to receive her Ph. D. the next day.</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all," Marjorie hastened to
declare. "You were always so immersed in work
that you never bothered with other people; but
those of us that thought it our duty to keep an
eye on the freshmen found our hands full.
Why the trips that I have made with my
Memorabilia under my arm to administer sugar-coated
pellets of college-spirit have cost me many a
good mark."</p>

<p>The reminiscences had filled the afternoon, and
now the college-bell rang out, warning the various
groups that dinner-time was at hand. With an
apologetic laugh Marjorie started up, saying as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
walked along, "Six o'clock, and I've talked almost
all afternoon! Well! Well! 'Tis but a sign of
age."</p>

<p>"Age, you goose," laughed Edith, "weren't you
always the 'garrulous particle'?"</p>

<p>"Well, weakness then, and a mistaken notion
that there is no place like Bryn Mawr."</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The beauty of the long June evening was not to
be resisted, and as soon as dinner was over, the
students hurried out of doors. An air of relaxation
was everywhere noticeable. Those fagged out by
examinations gained cheer and liveliness from the
more careless, or loitered about in unregarded
lassitude not disturbed by any sense of obligation
as contributors to the brimming talk of their companions.
It was the perfection of easy intercourse
where every sentence is a free-will offering.</p>

<p>However far the little knots of good company
might wander, they sooner or later gathered about
the steps of Taylor Hall to listen to the senior singing.
The effect was almost like a stage setting in
its perfection, the grey buildings, the intense
green of the grass, the blossoms on the trees, the
dresses of the girls, the group upon the steps, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the rays of the setting sun falling full upon it.
This custom of singing on the steps was an innovation
on the manners of the first years, but an
innovation picturesque and pathetic. Its pathos
touched the group of alumnæ standing at a little
distance from the steps. Throughout the afternoon
they had almost fancied themselves students again;
now they had stepped aside and had become mere
spectators, while the seniors were making the most
of their last days.</p>

<p>Before the singing stopped darkness had crept
upon the scene. Taking advantage of it Ellen
slipped away unnoticed and wandered down the
hillside. As she heard the strange voices singing
the old songs, she suddenly perceived how far she
had drifted away from her college days&mdash;from all
that had been revived by the chatter of the afternoon.
She could not but feel that Marjorie's power
of awakening those trifling memories, and Edith's
quick response to her whims and sallies, her
humorous allusions indicated not a less, but a
greater share in all that was vital and permanent
than any she could claim for all her seriousness. A
passionate regret rushed over her, aware now that
in her hurry, her business, her very faithfulness, she
had lost, almost past recovery, many of the privileges
that had been hers; that, in her pursuit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
ends, worthy enough to be sure, she had made no
demands on the really precious things in her
experience at college. For in this moment of
reflection, those trivial and petty reminiscences,
mere accidents in their student-life, became for her
the summons to an act of recollection.</p>

<p>She had strolled across the daisy field and was
standing on the brow of the hill looking out toward
the west. The moon had risen. Seen in its light
the sweep of landscape seemed to her more picturesque,
fuller of appeal to the imagination.
Details were lost sight of, contrasts of light and
shade emphasized. The slope before her lay in the
full moonlight. Beyond it a clump of trees showed
dark against the lucent sky. In the farther distance
the hills were wrapped in a soft mist, brightened
here and there by the gleams from the clustered
houses. The familiar scene was full of remembrances,
but remembrances for the most part of her
friendship for Marjorie and Edith. Long tramps
across those hills had been their favourite exercise
through the winter. The daisy field, the haunt of
idle moments in the warm days of spring or
autumn, had also been for them a special sort of
study, reserved for choicest reading. Toward it
too they had always wandered after the Sunday
evening meeting. As they walked along their talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
would drift from the subject of the evening to things
more personal, closer to their hearts, their individual
perplexities, their individual faiths. Each one was
then at her best, in the light of sympathy, showing
herself as good or as noble as she really was.
Those conversations, assumed to her kindled imagination,
an actuality, a power, hitherto unperceived,
becoming not only the record of their
preferences in all matters great or small, their
criticism of the activities and the thoughts of their
own little world, but also the measure of their share
in it. The little world thus recalled to her, had, she
was beginning to remember, its care for holiness,
for truth, for courage, and it had too its care for
orderliness and beauty in its very frivolities&mdash;and
there had been a discipline really stimulating even
in that. The genius of the place expressing itself in
this care showed itself in light-hearted frolic no less
than in scholastic endeavor, for it determined the
way in which things were done rather than actual
achievements, thus uniting in voluntary submission
to its influence those whom individual powers
separated from one another, informing them with
its spirit, till it became a part of them, not to be
changed without the loss of something individual.</p>

<p>How vivid it all was, how persistent, yet how
baffling its secret! Why could she not penetrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
this secret and possess it? But as before she could
neither arrest nor depict the ideas that were passing
to and fro in her mind. Her thoughts flew to her
speech. In it she had ignored everything but the
definite, the tangible, and in so doing she had failed.
Yet, even if she could seize the sentiment and translate
it into words, she dreaded misapprehension&mdash;she
could not forget her audience.</p>

<p>"Oh, here you are, Ellen," Marjorie broke in on
her reverie, "I've just been singing your praises.
It seems there are difficulties in the way of self-government,
and I thought I'd help them by giving
them a bit of our experience. So I told how you
brought us through that bitter time, when we so
nearly lost our liberties. As I told them I realized
as never before how impossible it is to pass on experience.
I could see before me the faces of the
girls so drawn, so stern, with that pitiful sternness
that only young faces catch; and then I seemed to
hear Dr. Rhoads in chapel that next morning,
reading to us that chapter about Grace and Law;
and I could remember just how he stopped and
looked at us after he read the words,&mdash;'<i>For sin
shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not
under the law but under grace. What then? Shall
we sin because we are not under the law, but under
grace? God forbid</i>,'&mdash;and then went on to tell us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
that he believed that those words expressed our
spirit and that as long as that spirit guided us we
could be trusted to govern ourselves. It seems
strange that while the impression of that time will
never fade from our minds, we can pass on nothing
but the tradition. There is no Dr. Rhoads
now," she continued after a pause, "and I think I
miss him more than I do any one else. He always
used to gather up the events of our life here and
put them into their proper relations."</p>

<p>"Yes, he entered with all his heart into the college
spirit just as though he were one of us,"
agreed Edith.</p>

<p>"And for that very reason," said Ellen, "no part
of his influence is lost. That spirit is the touchstone
for all of us. However variable it is the one
thing that persists and, so far, it has been as he understood
it. Each student, whatever her gifts,
must make it her own if she is ever to be anything
but an alien here."</p>

<p>"It always needs Ellen to give the finishing
touch," said Edith.</p>

<p>"If it had not been for you and Marjorie," insisted
Ellen, "I should still have taken counsel of
the cynical outsiders."</p>

<p>"Listen a moment," interrupted Marjorie, "that's
it after all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>A band of girls was coming toward them through
the moonlight and as they came they sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Thou Gracious Inspiration</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Our Guiding Star,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Mistress and Mother, All Hail Bryn Mawr.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>One morning some days later, Ellen was looking
out upon a delightful garden in Indianapolis. The
day was fine, if warm, and in the garden the roses
were in full bloom. She was in the highest spirits;
but her gayety of mood was a thing of the past five
minutes and had nothing to do with the sunshine
or the flowers. She was reviewing the occurrences
of the last week and entertaining herself greatly.</p>

<p>Her speech had been made the day before with
really brilliant success. It had been the most important
event in a series of notable meetings and
had been received in a way that might well have
roused her to fresh endeavour. Yet in the moment
of her greatest success she had shown herself
strangely indifferent to her manifest duty. This
was the result of her having discovered, just as she
had begun to accept the fact of her triumph and the
rewards that lay before her, that it was all due to a
surprising mishap, something altogether beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
her control. She showed that she felt the importance
of the occurrence by thinking of it steadily for
the rest of the day and well on into the night. This
was not because she wanted to think of it particularly;
indeed she had made every effort to dismiss
her preoccupation; but she could not rid herself of
the idea that an accident was responsible for her
triumph. In her perplexity she went over the
whole thing time and again.</p>

<p>There had been an inspiring audience, so much
she acknowledged, casting her mind over it. She
had observed it in the moments before the meeting
was called to order. Looking at the impressive
throng she had been annoyed to think that she
might have to use her notes. As she rose and
moved toward the desk there had been a sudden
hush and concentration of attention upon the platform,
of so much she had been distinctly conscious.
She had felt too that after she laid her notes on the
table and began to speak, the intelligent interest
which had greeted her opening sentences soon gave
way to an eager, fixed intentness and breathless
silence. Then all was a blank, till the restrained
enthusiasm broke forth.</p>

<p>As soon as the meeting was over she had been
overwhelmed by congratulations. Her one desire
had been to escape, and she felt it difficult to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
gracious to her admirers. She had managed at
length to get away, and handing her notes to a
reporter, had hurried to the door. There she had
been stopped by an old gentleman, who, though an
utter stranger to her, greeted her as an old friend.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Blake, you'll come home with us.
You'll not stop another minute at the hotel. No,
I'll not hear a word. I won't take a refusal. Nobody
has as good a right to you as I, your father's
old friend, Ned Cartwright." Then he had grasped
her warmly by the hand, exclaiming delightedly,&mdash;"My
dear young lady! My dear young lady! It
was your father over again, Harry Blake, Prince
Hal we used to call him. And is that the way you
girls feel about college? Bless me, I'd never have
believed it. I have heard so much solemn nonsense
talked about what you do and say and think.
But I'll never believe it again. Why, you might
have been talking about my own college days, and
your father's too,&mdash;Prince Hal we used to call him.
I'll never forget how we stole the clapper, he and I.
And they do it still, my dear, just as we used to,
and you steal your clappers too, and, bless me,&mdash;I'll
send every girl I can to college, if that's the way
you all feel about it. That's education! It isn't all
books,&mdash;never was and never will be. Just ask
your father and he'll tell you so too. Yes, I give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
you my word, every one of them shall go. I'll see
to it. I'd as soon shut them off from fairy stories
and Walter Scott, and falling in love, because they
were girls. It's romance, that's what it is and
they've a right to their romance; for I'm an old
man, my dear, and perhaps you'll take my word for
it, it's the romance of life that counts,&mdash;for the
girls as well as the boys."</p>

<p>While he was still talking Mrs. Cartwright had
come up with a welcome as hearty as his. Their
hospitality had been irresistible, and Ellen, powerless
before it, was soon walking with them to the
carriage. But just as she had been about to get in
she had been stopped once more.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Miss Blake," some one had said,
and there had stood the reporter with her manuscript.</p>

<p>"I think there must be some mistake," he had
gone on to say, "the paper you gave me deals
with the practical value of college life and you
talked this morning on what you called 'the Poetry
of College Spirit.'"</p>

<p>Then, as in a flash, Ellen had seemed to understand
the sense of something strange and bewildering
in the experience of the past hour, for she then
remembered that when she had stood facing her
audience in the moment before she began to speak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
she had seemed to forget her notes, her listeners
and herself, and to apprehend the meaning of her
four years at Bryn Mawr so clearly that it came to
have for her a sort of personal identity. Carried
beyond herself by her delight in the assurance of
something actual, she had spoken unpremeditated
thoughts. One might almost say, she thought,
that the memories revived by the visit to Bryn
Mawr, then crowded out by her intense preoccupation
in the business of the convention had, as in
revenge, taken possession of her, forcing all other
thoughts from her&mdash;had almost as it were expressed
themselves. Much that had puzzled her in
Major Cartwright's criticism was now explained.
A trick of memory accounted for all&mdash;even her
triumph. But she could recall nothing of her
speech. The words were forever lost.</p>

<p>She had been overwhelmed by the strangeness of
it all, and, do what she would, she could not keep
her thoughts from wandering from the Major's eager
questions of her father's doings to her own perplexing
experience. At one moment she had
seemed to be on the point of remembering the
speech, to have the words on the tip of her tongue;
the next to lose them more surely than ever.
Though the Major was constantly bringing it to
mind she was none the wiser for his references.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
That he had thought well of it she could not doubt,
but she wanted to know what she had said. Long
after she had gone to her room that night she had
sat thinking. The poetry of college spirit! What
had she said about it? Perhaps she had said something
absurd, had made her subject ridiculous. It
hardly seemed so from what she had heard. And
yet,&mdash;could she think that the inspiration of that
moment of discovery had lasted through an hour of
unconsciousness? How much more probable that
the shadowy something she had tried to define had
been so real to the memory or the imagination of
her hearers that the mere mention of it had for them
an instant fascination.</p>

<p>And now this morning, finding herself the first
downstairs, she had picked up the paper. She
would find out at last. A few moments ago she
had finished reading, and throwing the paper aside
with the impatience of disappointment, had stepped
out on to the porch. In those five minutes she had
come to view the whole thing with a lively enjoyment.</p>

<p>There was a column about it in the paper, but
no outline, nothing but praise and the hope that she
would make her speech fully effective by publishing
it. Was there perhaps a touch of malice in
that suggestion? Had the reporter grasped more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of the situation than she had chosen to tell? With
that thought amusement overpowered her,&mdash;amusement
at herself above all. That she of all
persons should be at a loss to know how she had
done precisely what she desired to do&mdash;please everybody&mdash;seemed
to her the perfection of irony. Her
comic imagination, once kindled, swept everything
before it, her self-importance, her views, even her
curiosity. Then a delightful feeling of irresponsibility
came upon her. The speech was none of
hers.</p>

<p>"Well now, what an early riser you are. I hope
you are not used up by the excitement of yesterday,"
came in cordial tones from the doorway and
Major Cartwright came out to bid her good-morning.</p>

<p>"What, all alone!" looking about him. "Haven't
you seen Mrs. Cartwright yet? She's been down a
long time. I suppose she's out among the roses.
We'll go on without her if you don't mind. She
likes to take her time and cut all the roses before
the sun gets hot, but it worries her to think she is
keeping me waiting. So I humour her and myself
too."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll not be asked to wait this morning,
my dear Edward, I've got them all gathered." And
Mrs. Cartwright came up from the garden with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
basket of roses on her arm. "Come away to
breakfast now. I'll arrange these afterward," leading
the way to the dining-room.</p>

<p>The Major picked up the paper in passing, and
looked at it.</p>

<p>"Oh here's all about your speech!" he cried,
"I hope they didn't garble it very much."</p>

<p>"Far from that," laughed Ellen, "they don't attempt
to tell what I said."</p>

<p>"What? You don't mean it. Nothing at all
about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, compliments enough to turn my head.
But the thought was evidently too much for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just listen to this, Lucy!" interrupted the Major
after a glance at the criticism. "I don't believe you
know what a distinguished young lady we have
with us this morning,&mdash;'Indianapolis has heard
much of the eloquence of Miss Blake, but Indianapolis
was not prepared for the glowing words
of yesterday.'" He read to Ellen's great amusement.
"'It would be folly to attempt an abbreviated report
of that splendid piece of oratory. Instead we
take pleasure in printing extracts from an article on
a more practical phase of college life, confident
that any words on woman's education from so
able an exponent will be of the highest interest to
our readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"'The speech made yesterday we predict, without
hesitation will never be surpassed by Miss
Blake,&mdash;it will be remembered as her masterpiece.'"</p>

<p>While he was reading Mrs. Cartwright had been
watching Ellen and had decided that she had been
blind the night before, for she had missed much of
the attraction in her face. Just now Ellen's eyes
twinkling with fun were fixed on the major's
face, and Mrs. Cartwright watched her with a
pleased smile.</p>

<p>"Your masterpiece he calls it," she exclaimed,
as her husband finished; "isn't that just like a reporter?
How does he know you'll never surpass
it?"</p>

<p>"Bless me, I don't see how she could surpass it,"
ejaculated the Major, "I'll not call the fellow a
false prophet yet."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you'll have the chance&mdash;ever,"
retorted Ellen. "I haven't an idea what I said and
by the time I make my next speech no one else will
remember."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, my dear young lady?"
he asked astonished. "It was never in the world
extempore."</p>

<p>"That or nothing." And Ellen, sensitive to a
genial change in herself, though, perhaps but dimly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
conscious of it, told the whole story with so keen
a relish for the satiric elements in it, that her
listeners were delighted. Her unconcern met with
no protest from companions too unfamiliar with
her ways to reproach her for not being quite
herself. Elsewhere she might not have dared to
disregard the imperious demands of what was
expected of her; but here she was not coerced
by any preconceived notions of what she was
likely to do.</p>

<p>"And it's all gone from you?" said Mrs. Cartwright.</p>

<p>"Yes, just as completely as if the thing had
never happened. It's just as though you had done
something very clever in a dream, and found when
you tried to do the same thing after you were
awake that you had forgotten the most important
part of it."</p>

<p>"But the fellow ought to have attended to his
business better," said Major Cartwright. "What
was he there for if not to report?" He took up
the paper again. "The man's a fool. A plea for
the higher education!"</p>

<p>"That's what it was meant for," murmured
Ellen.</p>

<p>"It converted you, anyway," contended Mrs.
Cartwright, nodding at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never heard anything so absurd," he went
on disregarding them. "Where did he get all
this stuff about the practical value of the higher
education?"</p>

<p>"From me, I am afraid. You see when he
found he couldn't have the best, he decided to
take the next best, and asked me for the notes
of the speech I intended to make. I tried very
hard indeed to catch my thoughts about Bryn
Mawr and pin them down for inspection as my
views on college life. But they escaped me, I'm
glad to say."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it of you. Why when you
got through you had stirred in me afresh the
enthusiasms of years ago."</p>

<p>"That's not so much of a compliment as it
seems, my dear," interrupted Mrs. Cartwright.
"His enthusiasm on some subjects is perennial.
It needs only the word 'college' to set him going.
But come along and help me with the roses.
If we go on like this, we'll begin to think you
just made an ordinary speech after all."</p>

<p>"And I do want to think it my masterpiece,"
said Ellen, rising to follow her. Then she turned
to the Major with a humorous diffidence that
hid a feeling too strong to show itself. "Perhaps
it is just as well that I have to stand on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
my attainment. If it were down in black and
white some critical person would be sure to discover
how much I owe to the eloquent ears of my
audience."</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Timothy Trask was an eminently correct young
man. His dress, his speech, his manners were all
the most correct of their kind. If he discovered
that anything was the proper thing to do, he always
did it, even to the extent of playing very poor golf
in an irreproachable pink coat. He was a great
lover of the antique, which is in itself a very correct
thing to be at the present time, and he possessed
a collection of ancient armour, which was
hung about on the walls of his wide front hallway,
a grim line of swords and battle-axes, and
great round shields.</p>

<p>Large as this collection was, in the mind of the
fastidious Timothy it was incomplete without a
certain Crusader's dagger, exposed to view in a
New York dealer's window. Timothy had stood
looking at this dagger with longing contemplation,
for once unconscious of his pose before the public
gaze. His imagination had conjured up an enticing
scene in which Timothy Trask figured as the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of an admiring throng of acquaintances, all watching
with breathless eagerness while he told the
story of the ancient dagger and pointed out its
jewelled hilt and the fine gold chains attached to
each end. Then he had counted over his railway
stocks, his mortgages and government bonds, and
had sadly taken the train back to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The dagger continued to fill an unobtrusive place
in the New York window, and an altogether too
prominent place in the mind of poor Timothy. All
his antiques grew tiresome and commonplace in
comparison with this one little jewelled hilt. At last
one evening he decided that he must have it if it
ruined him. With a sudden burst of confidence he
told the whole story to three friends in his smoking
room, and announced his intention of going to New
York the next day.</p>

<p>Unlucky confidence for Timothy! A look of
subtle meaning passed from one to another of the
friends. One of them, in spite of warning glances
from the others, picked up a copy of the <i>Ledger</i>
from the table, and nonchalantly pointed to a full-page
account of a May-day fête, reviving the Elizabethan
plays and dances, to be given the next day
at Bryn Mawr.</p>

<p>"Here's a lot about the learned ladies. Going
to give some sort of show or other. Elizabethan!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Hm! Reading extracts from history, I suppose,
perhaps all dressed up, like a Dickens reading.
It says something about 'correct costumes.' I
wonder if Tim's cousin is to be in it. Look here,
Tim, when are you going to take us out to see
that pretty cousin of yours?"</p>

<p>"I have not seen Marion Hall since she was a
child, and have no desire to make her acquaintance,"
said Timothy icily.</p>

<p>Because Timothy was so correct, he particularly
detested and disapproved of college girls. They
represented to his mind a mixture of spectacled
phenomena of learning, and of cheering, basket-ball
playing New Women. In either capacity he
found them peculiarly objectionable. He often said
of them, with a fervent horror he might have expressed
towards wild Indians, "I sincerely trust it
will never be my misfortune to meet one."</p>

<p>His feeling towards college girls was well known
to these friends and it had occurred to one of them
that it would be delightful to see Timothy at the
May-day festivity, surrounded by hordes of college
girls on their native heath. The incongruity of the
picture was so pleasing to the others that the idea
had been instantly seized upon, and they determined,
by some hook or crook to get Timothy to
Bryn Mawr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the avowed trip to New York gave them
their opportunity. One of them could meet him at
the station and manage in some way to lead him
astray.</p>

<p>The victim serenely played into their hands.
When the conspirators appeared Timothy was just
in the agony of trying to hide his near-sightedness
and at the same time discover which was his gate.
All the officials seemed occupied at that moment,
and he had no time to go back to the bureau of
information.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jenks, where are you bound for? I have
just two minutes. Can you see which is the New
York gate?"</p>

<p>"Over there," replied Jenks, unblushingly pointing
to the sign "Bryn Mawr special," under which
was a hurrying crowd in holiday attire. Timothy
noted the throng and bustle of an express, and
pushed through the gate just in time to get a seat.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To the May-pole let us on,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The time is swift and will be gone!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The blue sky, the green campus, the laughter,
echoing on every side, repeated the invitation of
the song, while the sun poured gayly through the
windows, and the voices without mingled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
those within. A breakfast party was in progress
on the fourth floor of Merion. It was not the first
time such a function had been held there, but this
morning the fantastic costumes of the guests, the
piles of gay cheese-cloth heaped in a corner, the
swords and plumed caps lying on top of notebooks,
gave the party an unusually festive and
holiday appearance.</p>

<p>A herald clad in yellow and white, adorned with
rampant lions before and behind, was scrambling
eggs by the window-sill, and a forester in a brown
jerkin was making coffee in one of the egg-shaped
coffee-pots so apt to turn upside down when least
expected. A marshal had just set fire to her blue
and red coat-of-arms, and was kneeling in front
of the divan, engaged in carefully pasting on a
patch.</p>

<p>Every now and then a knock announced a newcomer
whose costume was greeted with laughter
and eagerly examined. Presently a forester appeared,
in Lincoln green jerkin and smock. Her
arms were full of many-coloured banners, which
she proceeded to hang out of the window, flaunting
an expanse of purple lions and gilded dragons upon
the spring breeze. Then she procured a plate of
eggs and potatoes, and a cup of coffee, and sat
down on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have been indulging in a little archery
practice this morning," she said, laughing softly at
the remembrance. "It is going to be very picturesque
shooting down that avenue of trees, but it is
singularly fortunate that the target is safely out of
sight!"</p>

<p>"Don't be discouraged! Wait till you hear the
heralds striving to sound their horns," said the
sword-dancer, who was sitting on a perilous rocking-chair
without a back, while her hair was being
turned up beneath her collar. "There, listen to
them now!"</p>

<p>There came through the open window a feeble
noise, ending abruptly in a squeak, followed by
shouts of laughter. Looking out they saw a herald
standing with her head thrown back and her
trumpet raised to her lips, her tall, young figure, in
its white and yellow, silhouetted against the green
campus. A motley but appreciative audience paused
in the task of putting up May-pole streamers to applaud
her.</p>

<p>While the others were so engaged, the forester
came and sat down on the floor by the marshal, and
watched her put the finishing touches to the
damaged costume.</p>

<p>"Will you do something for me?" she asked, a
trifle shyly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"With pleasure," said the marshal, outlining
her coat-of-arms with black paint.</p>

<p>"Don't say you will so quickly. I had a letter
from some one, the other day, saying he was coming
to May-day. I wrote him that I didn't want
him, but&mdash;I am afraid he will come anyway, and
I don't want to see him."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the marshal, looking up.</p>

<p>"I can't make up my mind," said the other girl.
"I wish I could, but I can't, and I simply won't see
him till I do."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the marshal again. "I suppose you
want me to keep him out of your way?"</p>

<p>"If you only would," assented the forester, with
a pleading gaze.</p>

<p>"But my dear young innocence, there are going
to be a few thousand people here, more or less.
How am I to find one unattached young man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I only mean, in case you happen to hear of
his asking for me. People will come to you, you
know. Don't have him too much on your mind."</p>

<p>"I will try not to," said the marshal, dryly. "If
you will hear my advice, I think you had better see
him for yourself, and settle it, yes or no, one way
or other."</p>

<p>"You don't know how hard it is," murmured
the forester, with a little sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>The marshal rose to her feet with a grim expression,
which indicated that she would like the
chance of settling it. And with an inward remark
upon the nuisance of having men mixed up with
college functions, she went to the oval mirror and
put on her coat-of-arms.</p>

<p>"The rehearsal is at ten," she announced.
"Now, please be on time, every one, so that it
need not take <i>quite</i> the whole morning to form
the procession. Don't forget the cloaks for the
band, Elizabeth,&mdash;and do all of you remember that
<i>no one</i> is to wear patent leather shoes!"</p>

<p>She seized her marshal's staff and departed.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>When Timothy arrived at the Bryn Mawr station,
that afternoon, he found himself in the centre of a
dense crowd, which was surging up the road. He
had no liking for crowds, and avoided them on
all occasions. It annoyed him intensely to be
surrounded by indiscriminate numbers of chattering
people, pushing against him, and pressing him
along with them. In spite of his efforts to maintain
his usual dignified carriage, he was swept
along at a fairly rapid pace, through a gateway,
and up a long path to the side of a low stone arch;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
through which appeared a vista of gleaming white
road and green trees.</p>

<p>At Haverford when the familiar Cricket Club
came in sight, Timothy had come to a sudden
realization of the trick his friends had played
him. And when every one trooped out of the
train at Bryn Mawr, he had decided to yield to
curiosity and make the best of a bad situation.
But it was in no genial mood that he approached
the college. And now he almost wished he had
taken the next train back, to vent his anger on
those three friends.</p>

<p>He was sandwiched in between two stout ladies,
one of whom poked him in the neck with her
parasol, while the other explained the details of
Mary's costume, just completed the day before, by
the maternal sewing-machine. Timothy correctly
protected his necktie from the parasol's advances.
Taking out his eyeglass, he assumed his most extreme
expression of bored indifference, hoping to
indicate to every one around him that he, at least,
was not here willingly for a day's holiday, and
anticipated no diversion whatever from anything
forthcoming. The thought of himself, Timothy
Trask, inside a woman's college, waiting by the
roadside for a circus procession, was enough to
make him grit his teeth, and swear at the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
idiots who had been instrumental in sending him
there.</p>

<p>Suddenly a hush fell upon the expectant crowd.
With a blast upon their shining trumpets, eight
heralds appeared in Pembroke archway, dressed in
white and gold, with the Pembroke coat-of-arms emblazoned
upon their breasts. Behind came lumbering
along four oxen, great, patient beasts, decked
out with leaves and branches, dragging the May-pole.
Some mighty forest-giant had been sacrificed
to these revels. It was painted white, and
festooned with garlands. A line of flower girls
trooped along on either side, flowers in their arms,
on their short gay-coloured skirts, and adorning their
wide hats.</p>

<p>Laughter rippled down the line of spectators,
as through the archway came nine donkies, one
behind another, solemnly bearing the famous <i>Nine
Worthies</i> of Old English pageant. Odds, my life,
we find ourselves in high company! Here is
Julius Cæsar, clad in scarlet, with a truly Roman
nose, and behind him King Solomon, in all his
purple glory, while Sir Godfrey de Bouillon, that
virtuous knight, brings up the rear on a most restive
steed. Next, mounted on a high cart, came the
maidens of Spring, fighting their old battle with
grey-coated Winter. That is right, pelt him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
flowers, and cover his snowballs. He has no place
to-day.</p>

<p>It seemed as if Pembroke Arch were a gateway
to the past, and jovial Old England were pouring
through it.</p>

<p>Now came the ring of horses' hoofs upon the
stone paving. Make way, there, for Maid Marian,
the Queen of the May, with Robin Hood, that
gallant and sturdy rogue, riding by her side! There
followed all his merry men, come from the shades
of Sherwood to join in the revels, for what true
yoeman will not trip a measure with a pretty maid,
when the sun shines on May-day? Behind came
the fool, in motley red and yellow, bells upon his
two long ears, bells upon every point of his skirt
and cape, bells upon the sceptre which he shook
above his head. Happy fool, with light feet and
lighter heart! Treading close on his heels the
Hobby-horse was showing his paces. For the most
part he walked along, sedately enough, saving his
breath to curvet and prance, later on, in the <i>Revesby
Sword Plaie</i>.</p>

<p>With music and laughter the pageant moved on,
a train of shepherds with softly bleating sheep,
milkmaids, peddlers, ballad-mongers, and last of
all, mounted upon a float, a strange company indeed.
They were dressed in classic Grecian folds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
prepared to act in <i>The Excellent Pastoral of The
Arraignment of Paris</i>. Cupid is proverbially
abroad on May-day, but here he stood, in actual
guise, and Pan, too, playing his pipes, and stately
Minerva, with her snaky shield.</p>

<p>The pageant wound in and out, around the grey
stone buildings, a long thread of living colour.
Before Timothy well knew what he was doing, he
found himself pressing eagerly on with the crowd
to the May-pole green. The flower-crowned pole
was loosed from behind the patient oxen, and
borne upon eager shoulders to the centre of the
green. It was raised aloft in the air, tottered for an
instant, a great cheer went up, and it sank into its
socket. Then struck up the fiddles and pipes, the
dancers hastened to their May-poles, and holding
aloft the gay streamers began the dance with a bow
and a courtesy.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All fair lasses have lads to attend 'em,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Jolly, brave dancers who can amend 'em."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They wound the coloured ribbons about the four
poles, while the rest of the merrymakers danced at
will and to the lilt of the gay tunes, in twos and
threes, as their fancy led them.</p>

<p>Timothy watched two flower-girls, tripping a
measure with a forester, smiling at him over their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
shoulders, and finally giving him each a hand and
dancing away into the crowd. He felt his pulses
beat the time as they had never done in a ballroom.
It was the open air, and the gay costumes,
and the spirit of Old England, which had somehow
taken possession of him. Here was nothing
but sunshine and feasting and dancing all day;
and after sundown, rest under a hawthorn bush.
Timothy even longed to give a hand to that dainty
shepherdess and join in the dance.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come together, come, sweet lass,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Let us trip it on the grass."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Presently the music ceased and the dancers scattered
to their separate plays. Timothy suddenly
bethought him of his cousin. For the moment his
desire to claim acquaintance with an Old Englander
got the better of his hatred of college girls, and he
asked one of the nearest groups where he might
find Miss Hall. A tall marshal standing near heard
the question, and turned around with a start.</p>

<p>"Did you ask for Miss Hall?" she said. "I will
be glad to direct you if you will come with me."</p>

<p>Now Timothy was unaccustomed to having
young women, with golden hair, and shining, eager
eyes, hold out their hands to him, and say, "Come
with me!" He was so taken by surprise that with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
a mumbled, "Much obliged, I'm sure," he followed
her meekly through the crowd towards Dalton Hall.</p>

<p>"It is most unusual," he told himself with misgiving,
"for her to address me, a complete
stranger, in this way. It must be the policy of the
college to propitiate outsiders. I wonder if she
would do it to every one."</p>

<p>Then, quite irrelevantly, he wondered if he had
on his most becoming shape of collar. For some
reason he felt very tolerant towards this girl's naïve
eagerness.</p>

<p>Presently she turned back to him, and said:
"Would you not like to come over here and see
<i>The Ladie of the Maie</i>? It is such a pretty little
play."</p>

<p>"After all," thought Timothy, "no one knows
me here."</p>

<p>He followed her submissively to the very front
row of spectators, and sat down on the grass, a
thing he had not done before for at least ten years.
While they watched, the marshal explained that
these shepherds and shepherdesses were all grave
seniors, and in one more month would be Bachelors
of Arts in fur-trimmed hoods. She told him all the
old oral jokes, and Timothy, to whom they were
quite new, was much diverted. In return he raked
up his almost forgotten college tales. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
not new to the marshal, but she appreciated them
so sweetly that Timothy thought they must be even
more amusing than he had fancied.</p>

<p>The shepherds departed with their flocks of
white, softly-bleating sheep, but before the audience
had time to wish them back, a gay, rollicking ditty
struck up, and the chimney-sweeps came running
in, Jack-o'-the-Green leading. They joined hands
and danced around him in a circle, still to the same
rollicking measure, while Jack-o'-the-Green, peering
through his covering of branches and leaves,
bowed to each one in turn. The music stopped
with a quick chord, the chimney-sweeps dropped
to their knees and pointed their brooms at the figure
in the middle. Then the music began again, and
with their brooms in front of them, they ran out.</p>

<p>Timothy and his guide stood up, and moved
onward with the crowd. He began to feel that
there was no immediate necessity of finding Marian
Hall. He could just as well take a later train back
to town. The marshal was very courteous, and he
did not wish to appear rude by leaving her too unceremoniously.
He even wished something would
happen to detain him.</p>

<p>"I want to take you to the <i>Saint George Plaie</i>,"
said his guide. "It is very funny, and the grads.
do it with a great deal of spirit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Timothy's heart beat fast as he suddenly realized
that the marshal was purposely lengthening her
task, that she was no more anxious to find Miss
Hall than he was. Yet she had known him but
half an hour! It made him feel strangely humble.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said, "I have not even been
introduced to you?"</p>

<p>"Let me introduce myself," said the girl, gaily.
"Sir Marshal, at your service."</p>

<p>"And I am Sir Lancelot," he declared, modestly,
"just returned from the Crusades, and glad
to be back in merry England."</p>

<p>"Then, fair Sir Knight," said the marshal, "let
me guide you to where Saint George is slaying the
unbeliever in sport, as you have so often slain
him in reality."</p>

<p>With more of such agreeable foolery, they made
their way to where Saint George was indeed slaying
every one around him, to the diversion of the
spectators. For years afterwards the thought of the
Dragon, with rainbow snaky locks, writhing in the
throes of death, would bring to Timothy a smile of
retrospective amusement.</p>

<p>It was a staging fit for <i>A Midsummer Night's
Dream</i>. Pembroke was in the background, its
grey walls overhung with ivy. A green elm spread
its branches on one side of the open space, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the other was a cherry-tree, a mass of pink
blossoms, its soft petals carpeting the grass beneath.</p>

<p>There was no further question of finding Marian
Hall. Sir Knight and his guide wandered about
everywhere, and Timothy's friends would surely
have doubted their eyes, could they have seen him
taking in everything with the air of a happy child,
while he stated his theories on Old English dances,
and masques, and costumes.</p>

<p>At last he said: "Where is that fellow, Robin
Hood, whom I saw in the procession? He must
be shooting his arrows somewhere about the
green."</p>

<p>"I believe he is," said the marshal, without enthusiasm,
adding to herself, "How vexatious if I
cannot keep him away from there. He will see her,
of course, and my day's work will have gone for
nothing."</p>

<p>"I should like to see him immensely," observed
Timothy.</p>

<p>"It is a long walk," objected the marshal.</p>

<p>"Not <i>too</i> long, surely," said Timothy, with a
glance, adding persuasively, "I should hate to go
alone."</p>

<p>"I should hate to have you," cried the marshal,
with unmistakable sincerity.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Timothy, intoxication mounting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
his brain. He wanted to grasp some one by the
hand and tell him what an altogether pleasing and
agreeable world this was. "Ah!" he said again,
"we will go together."</p>

<p>The marshal flushed and murmured, "Idiot!"
Then she grew pinker than ever with vexation,
while Timothy watched her confusion with an
agreeable thrill.</p>

<p>"If he <i>will</i> go," thought the marshal, "I must
certainly go too, to see that he doesn't get within
speaking distance."</p>

<p>So they walked on, past Taylor Hall, and across
the May-pole green, down to the hill below Radnor,
where Robin Hood's men were holding forth. The
crowd of people surged and eddied past them. All
the wide expanse of campus was covered with
moving throngs, and dotted with the brilliant May-day
dresses. Banners of purple and gold and
crimson were flaming from every window.</p>

<p>"I have stepped right out of America," remarked
Timothy. "This place must be rather like a May-day
fête, even on ordinary occasions."</p>

<p>"I hope not," thought the marshal, wearily.</p>

<p>"Those grey stone buildings, with all that ivy,
are like feudal castles. I should think that the
girls wandering about must be rather decorative, if
they wear their caps and gowns."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," murmured the marshal.</p>

<p>"I feel like a trespasser," continued Timothy.
"The place just suits your costumes. We have no
business here. Why did you let us in?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what object there would have
been in getting it up, if we didn't let you in,"
said the marshal, striving not to be bored.</p>

<p>Timothy was still in the clouds as they pushed
their way into the inner circle of the crowd, just in
time for the finish of a bout at quarter-staff between
Robin Hood and Little John. Then Robin Hood
ran to the top of the hill, and blew a shrill blast
upon his horn. A shout answered him, and his
band of merry men, all clad in Lincoln green, came
pouring over the brow of the hill. Long ago, when
Timothy was a child, Robin Hood had been his
hero. He had procured a bow and arrow, and was
wont to strut about the back-yard, pretending to
shoot the dun deer. Here he was face to face with
the famous outlaw, and the old glamour gathered
about him. After the familiar scene of Little John's
christening, the drinking-horns were filled, and the
band threw themselves down upon the soft grass,
covered with violets. All listened while the minstrel
touched his harp, and the beautiful voice of
Allan-a-Dale sang the plaintive old ballad <i>Islington</i>.</p>

<p>Timothy was still hearing the echoes of the song<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
when his guide said to him, "It is all over. That
is the last of the day."</p>

<p>"I should like to see it over again," sighed
Timothy.</p>

<p>The girl laughed impatiently. "If you are going
back to town to-night, I am afraid you will have to
go at once. The train leaves in about ten minutes.
Good-night," and she held out her hand to him.</p>

<p>"Good-night," said Timothy. "Do you know,"
he said, "I have to thank you for one of the
pleasantest days of my life."</p>

<p>"I am very glad," said the marshal, not knowing
what else to say.</p>

<p>"I am going home to write a love-story," declared
Timothy, "all about Old England and May-day,
and you shall be the heroine!"</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said the marshal. "It
is getting very late, Sir Knight. I must really say
good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, good-bye, Sir Marshal&mdash;till next
May-day," cried Timothy. He stood still, looking
after her tall, erect figure, as she made her way
through the dwindling crowd.</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen quickly, and the space about
him was almost deserted. The great grey buildings
loomed up dimly in the twilight. A group of girls
strolled past him, singing <i>Islington</i>, and the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
brought back the sweet, plaintive notes. Timothy
still saw beside him the quaint figure of the marshal,
the curls flying out from beneath her rounded cap,
her eyes looking up at him as she explained the
May-day sights and sounds. It seemed hardly possible
that she was not a reality, that he could
stretch out his hand and not touch her. But he
would see her again; Philadelphia and Bryn Mawr
were not far apart. The distant train whistled, and
gave a few warning puffs, which rapidly increased
in number as it drew out of the station. Timothy
leaned against a tree and indulged in dreams.</p>

<p>Two foresters were standing near by, talking
eagerly. But it was some time before Timothy realized
the purport of their words.</p>

<p>"It was the funniest thing you ever heard of,"
one of them was saying. "Poor Eleanor! I saw
her with him some time ago, and now she has just
told me what happened. You see I asked her to
take care of Jack for me, and keep him from finding
me&mdash;why, yes, of course I had my reasons&mdash;and
somehow she got hold of the wrong man.
She has kept this creature with her all the afternoon,
<i>all the afternoon</i>, my dear, thinking he was <i>Jack</i>!
And she says he is the most awful stick, and has
bored her to death, poor dear! Isn't it a joke on
her? It is a good joke on me, too, because I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
so sure that Jack would come. I wonder why he
didn't!"</p>

<p>Lights were beginning to twinkle in the windows.
The chorus of <i>Islington</i> still came back on
the breeze, but it sounded quite different to Timothy.
Somehow everything had suddenly become
commonplace.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, with a deep breath, "it was a
pretty good joke on me."</p>

<p>Then he pulled down his hat, buttoned his coat,
and set off towards the station, with all possible
speed.</p>

<h2><a name="WITHIN_FOUR_YEARS" id="WITHIN_FOUR_YEARS"><i>WITHIN FOUR YEARS</i></a></h2>


<p>In the dry, warm darkness of a May evening two
girls lay on the grass near the tennis-courts north
of Taylor. It was in the days when the present
athletic field was only a roadway and a damp hollow
where dog-tooth violets grew. Radnor and
Merion loomed across the campus, their few lighted
windows betraying how little the spirit of study
possessed the hour. All the light and brilliancy of
the college seemed concentrated in Denbigh dining-room,
whence, through wide open windows, came
the laughter and songs of the supper the juniors
were giving the seniors.</p>

<p>There were sound and movement, too, in the
obscurity under the windows. Now and then a
hand and arm, or a head, rose from the shuffling,
murmuring mass, and for a brief moment came
into relief against the bright oblong of the window,
the hand in its withdrawal seeming always to carry
with it something very like a cup or a plate, which
was received below with shrieks or even some
boldly distinct remarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the girls on the grass sat up suddenly, a
stiffness of disapproval apparent in her attitude,
even in the dim light from the library windows.</p>

<p>"That is all a disappointment to me." She supplemented
her remark by a quick movement of one
arm in the direction of Denbigh.</p>

<p>"Why?" The other girl turned, resting her
head on her curved arm.</p>

<p>"To think that college girls can be so frivolous,
so silly. It isn't at all what I expected before I
came."</p>

<p>"You didn't suppose we talked in Greek all the
time, did you, Lilian?"</p>

<p>"Of course I didn't think absurdities, Clara.
But I did think college girls would be dignified and
serious, and wouldn't act like a rabble of street
boys. And <i>that</i>, I think is immoral." She rose
with her back to Clara, as from Denbigh came, full
and strong, reënforced by the voices of the freshmen
under the windows, the chorus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then here's to Bryn Mawr College,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Drink her down, drink her down&mdash;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Clara West clasped her arms around her knees
and rested her cheek on them, murmuring in a sort
of ecstasy, "I love it all."</p>

<p>Clara West was a quiet girl with odd impulses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
One of these had been to ask Lilian Coles to sit
with her for a while on the campus, as they happened
to leave the library together. The oddity in
this case was not that Clara was a sophomore and
Lilian a freshman&mdash;class lines were then very
loosely drawn. But Lilian was not the sort of girl
every one would choose to sit on the grass with
under the stars and listen to college songs. Lilian
had accepted only because she was waiting for a
reference book she wanted. It was this she now
went in quest of, after bidding Clara a rather impatient
good-night.</p>

<p>As she stopped by the half-open door of one of
the first floor studies in Merion, a tall girl with
smooth, red-brown hair parted in a straight white
line, swung herself around from her desk and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Coles! You have come for the 'Augustan
Poets'? I have just finished."</p>

<p>She wore a pretty organdie gown, for she was as
scrupulous in maintaining the tradition of dressing
for dinner as in every other detail of her well-ordered
existence. The study seemed rather bare,
but there were a few rich rugs on the floor and on
the flat couch, and large photographs of Greek
sculptures on the walls. A tea table by the hearth
was loaded with cups and saucers, cakes and sandwiches;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and thin steam was beginning to come
from a kettle hanging on an iron tripod.</p>

<p>"Won't you stay and have some tea?" Edith
Dareham asked, as Lilian turned away with the
book. "Some of the girls are coming in to talk
over our play for the freshmen next fall."</p>

<p>"No, thank you, I don't drink tea, and&mdash;I don't
believe in plays." With this bomb-like deliverance
Lilian disappeared. Edith looked bewildered and
rather pained.</p>

<p>"The people evidently don't want your 'panis et
circenses,'" mocked a voice close at hand, and a
pretty head thrust itself beyond one of the bedroom
portières.</p>

<p>"Oh, Blanche dear, are you there? Won't you
come out and help me make the tea?"</p>

<p>Lilian hurried out of Merion, meeting groups of
freshmen and sophomores. A few of them nodded
indifferently to her, but the majority seemed not to
heed her. As she crunched over the gravel toward
Radnor, where more lights were appearing, she had
a sharp feeling of discomfort, unrelieved by any
sense of heroism. She was well constituted for
martyrdom, but just now the performance of duty
seemed a very ungracious task.</p>

<p>Lilian was a victim of a world-old opposition,
taking form in her in a conflict between a habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
thought imposed by training, and certain essential,
though still latent, qualities of her nature. She was
in a stage of intense admiration for Edith Dareham,
unconsciously influenced by much in Edith that
appealed to the undeveloped side of her character,
though attributing her admiration wholly to the
obvious traits revealed in Edith's fine conscientious
work. Yet she felt an antagonism toward the fact
that Edith gave encouragement, or at least tolerance,
to certain features of college life that seemed
very reprehensible to Lilian, according to the peculiar
tenets of the religion in which she had been
trained.</p>

<p>Her father was a member of a small religious
sect, most numerous in the West, whose creed
would seem, to the uninitiated, to be wholly negative,
in its exclusion of all that makes for the brightness
of life. The sect, though small, was vigorous
in proselytism, and Lilian's father had been sent out
as a missionary, first to Germany, then to Switzerland.
Here had been for Lilian a vast increase in the
chances for education; and with a natural aptitude
and a child's facility she acquired a good knowledge
of French and German. The leaders of this sect
had established a small so-called college&mdash;really a
school for the study of the Bible, with their doctrinal
interpretations&mdash;because, in the anticipation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of an imminent ending of the world, they deemed
time too short to be spent on any other line of
study.</p>

<p>At about the time of Lilian's return to America,
the school had been placed in charge of a man of
good academic training, but of a difficult temper
that had driven him from place to place till he had
accepted this position as almost a last resort.
When Lilian was placed in the school he quickly
discovered the possibilities of her mind, and for
three years gave her a rigorous training. He then
advised her father to send her to college. Mr.
Coles was not blind to some of the advantages
shrewdly presented by the little instructor. He laid
the matter before a committee of elders of the society,
and consent was finally given. Before her departure,
Lilian was called into the presence of the
elders, and her opportunities for witnessing to the
"light" in a new field, her duty of non-compliance,
were solemnly, almost threateningly impressed
upon her. The college was chosen by the
instructor. The question of money presented difficulties
at first, but was finally arranged, and Lilian
went on for the examinations with a confidence
born of her teacher's encouragement, and justified
by her success.</p>

<p>To-night, as she went through Radnor, she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
hear laughter, singing, rustling and skurrying,&mdash;all
the relaxations of a Friday night, with festivity in
progress. There was something almost greedy
in the haste with which she lighted her lamp, closed
her door, and drew down the window shade.
Her unworded thought was that others might so
waste their time if they chose; she could not afford
to. Something of Lilian's reaction to her present
environment might have been divined from her
face. The forehead was of good shape, but too
full for the thin, refined lower features. At her
temples the veins were very distinct.</p>

<p>She studied until after the seniors and juniors returned
from their supper. Her thoroughness in
work was largely temperamental. She still looked
upon her opportunities in college simply as means
to greater efficiency in the missionary work she
had been chosen to do&mdash;work that was in fact the
propagation of certain peculiar theories. To her
simple thinking, it was a sacrifice of herself to
make the world better. Her anxiety over the approaching
examinations was great.</p>

<p>The next morning she would gladly have gone
to the library immediately after breakfast, but it
was characteristic of her that she went instead for
a two mile walk which she did not in the least enjoy.
The Gulph road, behind the college, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
green cathedral aisle, starred with the white flowers
of the dogwood. She did not know it. The rhododendrons
were in brilliant bloom on the well-kept
lawn of a country-place near the pond. She did not
see them. But when she came in she was sure
that she could not fail on Grimm's law.</p>

<p>Lilian's marks at the mid-year examinations had
been good, but not high enough to be striking, and
as she left college as soon as the May examinations
were finished and thus escaped the inevitable comparing
of marks, no one knew how high were the
grades she received. The excellence of her work,
however, unperceived during her first year, save
by very few, could not fail of notice as her sophomore
year went on, and after the result of the
February examination was known, aroused a dim
uneasiness among some very devoted friends of
Edith Dareham's. The general rough grading of
the members of the class during the first year is apt
to be accurate, and, with a little shifting, is accepted
as permanent in the second year. Edith Dareham
was now the recognized European Fellow of the
class of '9&mdash;.</p>

<p>"You don't suppose there is any danger, do
you?" was the query put to a group in a cozy
Denbigh study one February afternoon before
dinner. It was growing dark with a gathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
storm, and the wind was whirling clouds of snow
across the campus. In the room the gas was
lighted, a coal fire was glowing in the grate, and
two alcohol lamps were steadily burning. The
querist was Katherine Leonard, "a junior by
courtesy," she frankly qualified herself. Indeed a
degree for her did seem at least problematical, not
so much through neglect of hard work as through a
perverse inclination to interest herself ardently in
courses of reading quite foreign to her majors.
She was absorbed in literature and philosophy
while painfully struggling with mathematics and
physics, and as these latter subjects scarcely permit
a divided allegiance even to minds most gifted in
that direction, the issue threatened to be disastrous
for Katherine. But when urged to change her
majors she simply shook her head. She needed
the discipline, she said.</p>

<p>"Danger of what?" demanded Blanche Merrill,
Edith Dareham's roommate, with an abrupt turn to
Katherine.</p>

<p>"That Lilian Coles may take the fellowship from
Edith."</p>

<p>"Of course not! How absurd!" replied Blanche
superbly.</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure, Blanchette, dear," interposed
a tall girl who was writing at a table under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
gas. She was copying a lecture from her hostess's
notebook into her own, and kept on while she was
talking.</p>

<p>"Don't use that absurd name, Clothilde, any one
would think I was a Trouville donkey. You might
as well say 'Papillon.'"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I will. But <i>revenons</i>&mdash;the fellowships
are very uncertain certainties, and who can say
what will happen with a girl who gets high credit
in the gym."</p>

<p>"Then Edith may as well give up." Katherine's
small form yielded to a spasm of laughter at the recollection
of Edith's doing two hours a day in the
gymnasium in order to avoid a condition.</p>

<p>"Yes," commented Blanche, "when Edith went
to the gym before breakfast, Katherine would go
and hold Thucydides up before her, so that
Edith could put a last polish on her translation
while she was doing chest weights and quarter
circle."</p>

<p>"That isn't really true, you know," Katherine
coolly joined in the laughter of the others. "That
is, it's true only to the spirit, not to the fact.
I would have done it if it had been necessary.
But really it would be unjust to the college to
give the fellowship to a girl who won't go to
a tea."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is Miss Leonard here?" In response to a low
rap some one had opened the door to Lilian Coles
who stood a little bewildered at the contrast between
the still unlighted hall and the bright room.
Katherine freed herself from the group on the
floor.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have brought that book. I wish you
hadn't. I'll have to read it now. Come up, and I
will give you the other. I haven't read it. I have
been skating all the afternoon. Mabel, please
hand me my skates."</p>

<p>"Won't you come in and have a cup of cocoa?
It is so cold outside," Lilian was temptingly
urged by the fair-haired girl who was nominally
mistress of the study, though both she and her
roommate were usually obliged to work in the
library, so thoroughly did a reputation for hospitality
characterize their room. Lilian wanted to
go in, but without hesitation declined and started
away with Katherine.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," Katherine touched Lilian's
arm and turned back to the open door. Two
girls had begun to sing, in response to the guitar
of a third,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Drink to me only with thine eyes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While Katherine listened to the song, Lilian's eyes
rested curiously first on the sensitive face, then on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the black sweater, short corduroy skirt and heavy
boots that made up Katherine's skating costume.</p>

<p>"I am glad I am not so conscientious as
Helen Arnold," Katherine said, at the close of the
song. "When her aunt wanted to take her to
Bayreuth last summer, she wouldn't go, because,
not having an intellectual appreciation of music,
she couldn't, forsooth, permit herself so much
emotional enjoyment." Lilian looked puzzled yet
stern. She could not but approve the action, though
the motive seemed to her unnecessarily refined.</p>

<p>Katherine's rooms were on the second floor.
When the two girls entered, the study was in the
shadowy dimness of grey twilight cheered by a
warm fire. Katherine lighted an old Venetian
lantern and some red-shaded candles, then drew
the sash curtains which were of dark red silk
with arabesques of fine gold lines. Above the
mantel hung two carbon photographs of Fra Angelico
angels in vellum frames; and at one end
stood a bronze of the Flying Mercury, at the other
a cast of the Olympian Hermes. On the walls
were photographs of Matthew Arnold, Christina
Rossetti, and Cardinal Newman; also some prints
that Katherine fondly believed to be original Dürers.
These objects had not the interpretative value
for Lilian that they might have had for another;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
but the whole suggested luxury to her, and her
eyes turned away disapprovingly to fall with a sort
of startled horror on the recess left between two
bookcases, where, against a dark background,
hung an exquisite ivory crucifix. Lilian's attitude
toward Catholicism was of the original Puritan
inflexibility, strengthened by the exaggerated hatred
of the class of people among whom she had lived.
And she knew nothing of any concessions due to
the opinions of others. The crucifix represented
merely a sympathy, not a tendency on Katherine's
part. But this fact, even if it had been known to
Lilian, would have served none the less to intensify
in her a feeling of radical difference between Katherine's
governing ideals and her own.</p>

<p>When she entered Radnor on her return, two
girls were coming slowly down the stairs, absorbed
in confidential chat. They smiled at Lilian as she
passed, but she knew that she had no share in the
friendship expressed even by the touch of Clara's
hand on Ethel's shoulder. She drew herself up
sharply, remembering her longing to enter Florence
Baker's bright, gay study.</p>

<p>Her way to her room took her past the single
suites. The door of one was open, and within
were trunks and signs of packing.</p>

<p>"Are you going away?" she paused to ask.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Gertrude Elbridge, a pretty little freshman, came
forward and drooped against the door.</p>

<p>"Yes, you know I have been ill since the examinations,
and papa has sent for me."</p>

<p>"I am sorry." This was true, as Lilian had a
mild fondness for the child, despite the fact that,
through evenings of loud and prolonged hilarity,
Gertrude and her friends had made life a burden to
Lilian, and with direct consequence, to the members
of the Executive Board of Self-Government. Lilian
went on to her room, indignation possessing her.
She knew why Gertrude was going away. Before
each examination Gertrude had studied all night,
her head bound in a wet towel. The towel really
bothered her, but she knew that was what her
brother did. She had kept awake on strong tea and
coffee supplied by sympathizing friends. But evidently
even these frantic efforts had not proved redemptive.</p>

<p>"Why," Lilian asked herself, "did not the
stronger girls of the college bring a pressure of
sentiment to bear against these follies, instead of
encouraging them by their own customs?" Was it
not her duty to make some protest? An unavailing
one it would doubtless be, but surely it is only a
lukewarm reformer that considers results rather
than principles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>She had returned to college in the fall with a
strengthened antagonism to what her father called
the worldliness of college life. His influence was
still dominant with her. His vision was crude, and
he denounced, with a solemnity appealing to the
girl's native earnestness, all the joyous innocent
froth of amusement that danced over the current of
the real, serious life of the college.</p>

<p>In truth, Lilian had departed further from
her father's beliefs than she realized. She had
already gained an historical perspective and a certain
habit of cool unbiased judgment that were
forcing her to see in what ignorance and narrowness
of mind those beliefs were conceived and
accepted. At the same time the studies that had
modified her views, tended to increase her sense of
the preciousness of time, of the seriousness of life.
Her loyalty to her father's teachings was stirred by
an unanalyzed appreciation of the change in herself.
And now, in the failure of Gertrude Elbridge she
seemed to find a justification of the rigidly prohibitive
lines her father would throw around all
conduct. She could not see, yet, that the weak
have their hard lessons to learn in the opportunities
of the strong.</p>

<p>Unfortunately opportunity was not lacking Lilian
Coles for that word of protest she felt bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
to utter. She always attended the Sunday evening
meetings, though little in sympathy with their
spirit. The next Sunday she went early. Into the
dimly lighted gymnasium came the girls, eyes
sparkling and cheeks red from the clear cold air
without. Nearly all were wrapped in shawls, but
one girl wore a hat and coat and carried a bag.
There was a big bunch of violets on the lapel of her
coat, and she smiled rather consciously at some comments
of the girls she joined. In the first row of
chairs were some dignified seniors whom Lilian
rather feared, and a junior who at once attracted and
repelled her. She was, in spite of herself, fascinated
by a cleverness that manifested itself in every
department of the college, that would be a force in
literature some day, so every one said; and at the
same time she had a feeling that there was nothing
the girl would not sacrifice to ambition.</p>

<p>At last Helen Arnold, who was to lead the meeting,
came in accompanied by Edith Dareham.
Helen was the girl who had refused to go to Bayreuth.
She busied herself with great care in
arranging the books and lamp on a little table.
Her friends knew that she was embarrassed. She
was a frail-looking girl, one who set a high value
on things that were still unapprehended by Lilian,
in their real nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>She began with a short quotation and took, as a
point of departure, the lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That thread of the all-sustaining beauty<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which runs through all and doth all unite."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With well-chosen words she modestly brought
out her thought of the duty of each one to seek for
this thread of beauty in all things. Then she spoke,
with a little more insistence, of the beautiful in art
and in nature, which, she believed, demanded for
its true appreciation the highest cultivation not only
of mind and age, but of soul as well.</p>

<p>After a short silence, Elizabeth Carrington, Helen's
roommate, spoke, weaving Helen's thought into the
larger one of that endeavor toward perfection sacredly
enjoined upon us. With an impatience born
of the incomprehension of her mood, Lilian had
listened to Helen. She did not hear Elizabeth, who
had scarcely finished speaking, when Lilian rose.
The girls looked surprised; but after the consecrated
formula&mdash;"It seems to me"&mdash;various expressions
replaced the surprise. Some of the listeners looked
coldly bored or contemptuous, a few were amused,
but the majority sat ill at ease with pained faces.
Lilian was arraigning them for so much time spent
in idle conversation, and in "feasting"&mdash;she fiercely
put it. She denounced them for their plays, their
dancing. In her excitement she assumed the tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and phraseology of the denunciations she had been
accustomed to hear from childhood and she went
farther than she intended. She said their pursuit of
knowledge was only for its vain shows. The nature
of the silence into which her words fell should have
warned her, but some confused association of ideas
carried her on to a bitter allusion to Catholicism.
She was recalled to herself by the indignant protest
on Helen's face. Clothilde and one or two others
present were Catholics. Lilian choked and stopped.</p>

<p>"Shall we not sing?" suggested Helen. Clothilde
started the hymn. There was no more
speaking. Lilian was the first to leave the meeting.
She went out with unseeing eyes and hot cheeks,
alone. There are times when even the kindest
hearts are cold, and for the moment there could be
nothing but alienation from one who had found
tongue against the college spirit&mdash;for they felt that
the attack was really against this vague, shadowy,
stern, beloved thing of many hues and many forms&mdash;the
spirit of the college.</p>

<p>Outside, the moon had risen in a clear star-powdered
sky, and was silvering the crusted snow and
the ice sheaths that rain and frost had left on every
twig and branch of the trees. The sparkle and
splendour of the night only smote Lilian as a part of
that whole body of beauty which, it seemed to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
excited thinking, had been presented that evening
as of equal importance with goodness and morality.</p>

<p>There is little tea drinking on Sunday evening.
Many girls are away. It is the time for writing
home letters, or doing a little quiet reading. The
rooms never seem so warm or the lights so bright
as on other nights. The halls are still and everybody
goes to bed early. But this night there was a
little more excitement as girls stopped to talk with
indignation, amusement or indifference of Lilian's
outburst. Katherine Leonard found several girls in
Edith's room when she stopped, after an errand in
Radnor. She sought each face questioningly, then
dropped on the couch. "How awfully <i>funny</i>&mdash;how
dreadful it was!"</p>

<p>"I can't understand the state of mind that would
lead to that," said Alice Warburton. "Where has
such narrow-minded egotism been fostered? Such
injustice! What an arid life she must have known."</p>

<p>"I admire her!" said Elizabeth Carrington decisively.
"I was near enough to her to-night to see
how tightly she clung to the chair in front of her.
Her knuckles were all white and shiny. It was real
heroism. I doubt if any one of us will ever show
as much."</p>

<p>"I should hope not!" Blanche commented energetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a girl lying on the couch who had
been reading <i>Diana of the Crossways</i>, all this time.
She occasionally made notes on the margins. Now
she looked up. "For my part, I prefer goodness to
cleverness," was all she said. Then she went on
reading again. The girls all laughed a good deal.
Then there was silence, and some of them laughed
again&mdash;a little. Some of them were very much of
Lilian Coles' opinion in regard to this girl, who was
the junior Lilian had noticed in the gymnasium.</p>

<p>"She has greatly relieved my mind, at any rate,"
said Katherine. "She can never hope for the fellowship
now."</p>

<p>"You have no right to say that." Edith was a
little sharp. She was somewhat troubled within
herself. She liked the serene state of mind that her
usual conduct of life granted her, and hated a mean
feeling with an intensification of the disgust that
any contact with uncleanness gave to her physical
fastidiousness. In the dissatisfaction that she had
occasionally felt of late, it had occurred to her that
she might settle issues with herself by some plan
involving sacrifice on her part. But injustice was
no dearer to her than selfishness. She fell asleep
that night with the healthy resolve not to be
troubled by what she could not help.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lilian Coles was lying on her bed, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the dark, with wide-open eyes. She was restless
with a shamed sense that she had violated her finest
instincts. She continually wondered how she <i>could</i>
have done such a thing. Then all the questionings
that had been forming in her deeper consciousness
for nearly two years, came forward, insisting on a
hearing. Helen Arnold's talk that evening passed
through her mind with a new meaning and force,
but she was too much exhausted then to come to
any conclusions. She finally fell asleep, hoping
that every one would be too busy to remember her
speech very long.</p>

<p>One Saturday morning in the spring Lilian started
downstairs. It was late, she was tired and vexed
at her slothfulness. She had gone to bed the night
before so tired that one night's rest was wholly insufficient.
As she reached the foot of the stairs a
girl came out of the bathroom with a kettle of water.
She nodded to Lilian, went on, then turned.</p>

<p>"Miss Coles, you are sure not to find anything
hot for breakfast. Won't you come into my room?
We are going to have breakfast there."</p>

<p>Lilian hesitated. Something, perhaps an animating
suggestiveness in the spring air that was sweeping
through the windows, perhaps the mere yielding
of tired flesh to kindly human influences,
moved her to accept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Hester Grey's room looked over the fields and
low hills. Two study tables had been put together
and were covered with white embroidered cloths.
A bowl of violets was on one table and a dish of
strawberries on the other, while the more substantial
provisions for the breakfast were on a side-table.
This separation was due to an arbitrary distinction
of Hester's, food taking precedence in her
ideas according to its appeal to the eye.</p>

<p>There were two girls in the window-seat and
another in a steamer-chair. This one sprang up
and insisted on giving Lilian the chair, tucking the
pillow behind her with an unceremonious friendliness
very grateful to Lilian.</p>

<p>Then she began cutting bread, urging that some
one else pass Lilian the olives.</p>

<p>"Do you think you will want more sugar in
your cocoa?" Hester asked Lilian. "Of course
she will," said one of the girls in the window,
without looking up from her book. "You never
make it sweet enough." Lilian thought this was
very rude, but Hester didn't seem to notice it. She
carried a cup to Lilian, who looked at her curiously.
Lilian had always had a thought of scorn in her
opinion of this girl, whose erratic work, spasmodic
brilliancy and general idleness were known to the
whole college. Lilian knew that she would sit for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
hours on the stone wall of the Harriton burying
ground doing nothing, even if examinations began
the next day. No one ever seemed to be able to
foretell whether she would get High Credit or a
condition in any examination. Lilian had seen her
absorbed in <i>Treasure Island</i> the day before the
English essays were due. Hester's essay on Keats
was written in one night, so rumour said. It received
the only High Credit. Lilian had read it,
with something like astonishment at the feeling
aroused in herself by the revelation of another girl's
mind. She had come to have a feeling like reverence
for this girl, realizing at last that some gifts of
the spirit are not to be measured by so many hours
of study, so many hours of exercise. And now
this same girl was apparently concentrating her
whole mind on the amount of sugar to be added to
each cup.</p>

<p>Then Lilian had to think a little about the other
girls in the room. They had always seemed to her
commonplace, doing but indifferent work. At
least they had won no distinction. She knew that
the five were close friends, that they couldn't have
the fullest enjoyment with her in the room, yet
they were unaffectedly genial and hospitable to her.
While she, with a perversity which shocked her,
did not care if they did enjoy themselves a little less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
on her account. She wanted what they were giving
her.</p>

<p>It is a truism that some actions most important
to ourselves or others often seem but pure whim.
Hester could have given no reason&mdash;in fact, it was
not her habit to await reasons&mdash;for asking Lilian
Coles to take a walk with her that morning. And
Lilian, to whom even tying her shoe was often occasion
for a mental inquisition, did not care to explain
to herself why she accepted the invitation
with eagerness. She had intended to spend the
morning in making a tabulation and synopsis of
some second year English reading. But the pain of
that unforgettable Sunday evening had wrought in
Lilian a distrust of her own valuations, and she
went with Hester willingly.</p>

<p>The morning freshness was still in the air.
Hester took Lilian through the woods where the
starting leaves wreathed the grey tree-trunks and
slim branches like trails of green smoke; to a wide
bed of spring beauties; past the pond fringed with
willows; across the fields to a stream that flung
itself over the rocks with a sparkling abandon to
the joy of spring. Lilian saw all these things; and
she saw, too, the contrast between the rich black of
new ploughed fields and the vivid green of winter
wheat. She heard a bluebird singing above them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
They went on to an old ruined mill, shadowed by
tall dark pines whose roots were washed by a wide,
shallow creek. Across the stream, there were
woods. Here the girls sat under the pines and
Hester read aloud from <i>Undine</i>. Gradually the
wash and splash of the creek were transferred from
Lilian's outward to her inward hearing and seemed
to be singing to her of a spirit that was in the
water. Suddenly she had a vision of the meaning
of the old pagan ideals. She lay back on the grass
and let her eyes look very far into the blue above
the pines. It occurred to her that she would take
some books home in vacation and read all the
poems noted on the margins of her Horace. She
understood now, she thought, something of the
delight in that year's work which all the others in
the class had expressed and which she had, in some
way, missed.</p>

<p>They stopped to rest again on the stone wall of
the old burying ground in the woods, and Hester
read from Chaucer following her own liking wholly.
Lilian went back to her room with a new sense of
the beauty of nature, and of the dignity of free,
wholesome joyous human life.</p>

<p>There was no time before luncheon for the intended
tabulation of ballad poetry, and in the
afternoon she turned at once to the assigned reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
in Wordsworth and Coleridge. Before coming
to college Lilian had been allowed to read very
little. Even her study of the Bible had been
scarcely more than a search for texts and illustrations
in support of the beliefs of her sect. All
through this year the reading presented to her had
been stimulating her imagination and perception.
But partly from habit and partly from the fact of
having detected a pleasure in the exercise of these
faculties, she had continued to read mechanically
and blindly. Now for the first time she permitted
herself to read with something more than a desire
to go over so many pages in a given time. As she
finished the <i>Hymn of Chamouni</i> she caught her
breath as one whose spirit has been lifted to an
unknown height.</p>

<p>The twofold process of growth, of putting off
the old and acquiring the new went on in Lilian
with alternations of pain and pleasure, the latter
increasingly predominating. When she entered
college and for sometime after, she had her father's
contempt for what he called "mere learning."
But she was led to a very different way of thinking
by a better understanding of what scholarship
means&mdash;of its untiring zeal and care for truth, and
of its outlook beyond the fact to the including law.
She even came to accept an opinion that, later on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
she found thus expressed: "... our deeper
curiosity. There is a sense in which it is all superfluous.
Its immediate results seem but vanity.
One could surely live without them; yet for the
future, and for the spiritual life of mankind, these
results are destined to become of vast import."
Lilian's nature was such, however, that she must
always care chiefly for the immediate practical application
of the idea.</p>

<p>During her junior year she did some elective
work in sociology which completely revised her
ideas of philanthropy. She saw how very inadequate
were the measures that she had once thought
essential to doing good in the world. Her hope of
being a missionary was too much a part of herself
to be given up easily, yet she knew that she could
not represent her former views. She became greatly
interested in college settlement work but she found
no time to give to it, for she gave to tutoring all
the time that she could spare from her regular
work. The mental submission and the claim upon
her future involved in the arrangement by which
her expenses were paid had become impossible to
her, and she wished to become self-supporting as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>One Saturday morning she was sitting in the biological
laboratory, carefully correcting her drawings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of nitella, when Miss Hardy, a graduate student
with whom she had done some work in sociology,
came in and bent over her.</p>

<p>"Should you not like to go into town with me
this evening to one of the social meetings of a
working-girls' club which has been organized recently?
I think you would be interested."</p>

<p>After a moment's thought Lilian decided to go.
A girl whom she tutored every Saturday afternoon
was ill and that time could be given to the usual
Saturday evening work.</p>

<p>When they reached the Broad Street Station, Lilian
was surprised to find Helen Arnold, who had been
spending the afternoon in town, waiting for them.
The clubhouse was in the lower part of the city.
After their arrival there, Lilian spent an hour in eager
inspection of the small library, the schedule of
classes, and the furnishings of the rooms. Helen
had disappeared. Lilian asked for her, and Miss
Hardy explained, "She comes every Saturday if
she can find any one to go to and from the station
with her. She is teaching two or three girls
who can have better positions as soon as they can
write and spell better. This is the only time they
have."</p>

<p>Then they went into a large, brightly-lighted room
with a waxed floor. There was a piano at one end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
and some one was beginning to play. The girls,
most of them neatly and prettily dressed, were
gathered near the piano, while a few young men,
with very smooth hair and rather conspicuous ties,
stood in stiff self-consciousness near the door.</p>

<p>"Young men of good character are invited in
once a month," whispered Miss Hardy.</p>

<p>A half-grown girl, in heavy shoes, a crumpled
red dress, with a soiled ribbon knotted around her
neck, crossed the room and stood in front of Lilian.
Her open scrutiny was beginning to be embarrassing
when Helen came in. She touched the girl on
the arm, and was soon leading the clumsy shoes
lightly through a waltz. After two or three turns
Helen sought some one else, and the girl returned
to Lilian.</p>

<p>"Say, ain't she sweet?" she said, looking after
Helen with eager eyes. "She teaches somethin'
here, and I'm go'ne to learn it. And I want some
white ties like she wears."</p>

<p>It was still early when they started for the station,
but on the streets Lilian saw one or two things that
made her glad to think of the many girls they had
left in the simple pleasures of the carefully-guarded
clubrooms.</p>

<p>A slight delay caused them to miss their train, and
they had to spend half an hour in the waiting-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Miss Hardy found some evening papers.
Helen declined the one offered her, and drew a book
from her shopping-bag.</p>

<p>"What reading is this, Helen?" Miss Hardy
laughingly questioned. Helen blushed a little. "It
is really only the third." On the train the book
happened to lie for a moment in Lilian's lap. She
noted the title. It was <i>Marius, the Epicurean</i>, and
at her earliest opportunity she procured the book and
read it.</p>

<p>She read it with intense interest. Here were a
care for life&mdash;for its pleasures&mdash;and a consecration
of time that found no necessary detail too small for
perfection. The charm of the book was upon her&mdash;its
flawless form, its sanity, its strenuousness.
There was something of the old defiance in her attitude
toward this epicureanism, though the character
of it was so exalted and pure. But at the
close, when Marius simply puts himself aside and
accepts death that his dear friend may live&mdash;happy
in a love denied Marius&mdash;she put the book down
very softly. By the profound stirring of her sympathies
she felt how absolute was her acceptance of
the whole character&mdash;as consistent with itself in sacrifice
as in æsthetic enjoyment.</p>

<p>The constantly increasing deference given Lilian
because of the quality of her work contributed much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
to her contentment. The freer play of her intelligence
was making itself felt. By the beginning of
their senior year Lilian Coles and Edith Dareham
were undoubted rivals for the European Fellowship.
But the real excitement over the fellowship was not
apparent until after the mid-year examinations.
Then the strain began to be wearing on the two
girls and their friends.</p>

<p>"I wish the Faculty would come to a decision,"
said Katherine Leonard one evening in Clothilde
Barry's room. She was on the window-seat between
a big palm and a pile of notebooks. "If
they don't very soon, I'll not get a degree in June.
I love this place but I don't want to stay here all
my life. It would be hard to fix my affections on
another class. But I can't study till I know."</p>

<p>"I think that possibility would stimulate them,
if they only knew&mdash;" began Blanche.</p>

<p>Just then the door was flung open and Alice
Warburton came in impetuously&mdash;her usual manner,
but some dramatic quality in this present haste
must have made itself apparent, for the other girls
assailed her breathless silence with questions.
What she finally said was: "There is a Faculty
meeting in Taylor." After a moment of comprehending
silence, Blanche went out quickly. Katherine
followed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blanche, if you find out before the doors are
locked, won't you come and tell me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how it will be." Blanche looked
anxious and wouldn't stop. Katherine went back
to Clothilde's room, and after she had tipped over
the palm and broken the jardinière was advised by
Clothilde to go home and go to bed. In her own
room she took a physics laboratory book and made a
feeble attempt to put order into its chaos, but only succeeded
in dropping ink over two important calculations.
Then she took down a volume of Mazzini's
writings in which she had lately become much
interested. At the end of half an hour she became
aware that she had not turned a page. She left her
room and went down to the parlour. All the lights
were out, even in the rooms. Over in Taylor
there was a dim light in a second floor window.
It had no connection with the Faculty meeting, but
she chose to consider that it had, and crouched,
shivering, in the window until it went out. Then
she went stiffly to bed and slept badly. The next
morning Blanche came to her soon after breakfast.
"Edith wants to see you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Blanche?" But Blanche was already
backing out of the door. "I can't tell you anything.
Edith hasn't told me anything." Every
line of her face was non-committal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Edith was sitting at her desk writing when
Katherine entered. She looked over her shoulder
and smiled, but she was very grave. "I have it,
Katherine."</p>

<p>Katherine sat down on the window-seat, and
bending over pressed her forehead down on Edith's
shoulder. Edith turned about and lifted Katherine's
face. She was crying&mdash;Katherine, in whom the
repressions of stoicism had been the least fleeting
of many moods. After a while Katherine said,
"We were afraid at one time, Blanche and I&mdash;that
you might do something&mdash;rash." It was not
necessary for Edith to ask what she meant. She
hesitated before speaking. "I have felt troubled.
It isn't reasonable, but I haven't been able to get
rid of an uncomfortable feeling about Lilian Coles.
I <i>could</i> go to Europe without the fellowship, and I
suppose she can't. But&mdash;I wanted it. I did try to
think of some way of helping her when I heard
last year that there was danger of her having to leave
college. But even if I had had the money&mdash;that's
a sort of thing it is almost impossible to do. It
might have seemed a generous thing for me to let
my work go a little, but I could not be sure that
she wouldn't do better than even my best. And,"
Edith gripped the desk hard, "it would have
seemed to me a simply wicked sentimentalism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
to do poor work deliberately for any reason whatever."</p>

<p>Katherine released the sleeve of Edith's gown that
she had held crumpled in her hand. "I am so glad
you felt just that way."</p>

<p>Blanche came in then to gather up her notebooks.</p>

<p>"How did you find it out, Blanche?" Katherine
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh. I found the note under her door when I
came down from Ethel's room last night"&mdash;Ethel
was Blanche's sister&mdash;a freshman. "We had been
sitting up watching. But Edith was sleeping like a
baby. I lit a candle and roused her and gave her
the note. I must say she was rather excited until
she got the note open and read it." Blanche
stopped. "Did she tell you then?" prompted
Katherine.</p>

<p>"She hasn't told me yet. That honour was
reserved for you. She lay down again and I
kissed her and covered her up and told her to be
a good fellow. Then she laughed and so did I, as
silly as two loons. She went to sleep. I went upstairs
and awakened Helen and Elizabeth. I did not
tell them anything, but they understood, and we
talked until two in the morning. Imagine Elizabeth
and Helen sitting up till two!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Katherine was popular enough in college, but
that did not account for the way numerous groups,
from seniors to mid-year freshmen, obstructed her
going from Merion to her own room, and thence to
Taylor. They asked her unimportant questions,
and eyed her curiously. Her face was impassive.
The chapel was unusually full. Edith's friends
had gathered around her in her usual seat, well
forward.</p>

<p>"But that doesn't mean anything," whispered a
high freshman voice, "they'd be there just the same
anyway."</p>

<p>Lilian's chief supporters were among the graduate
students. Those from other colleges looked rather
defiant. A few members of the Faculty came in
and sat in the back seats. After the short exercises,
the announcement was very quickly made. During
the storm of applause that greeted Edith's name
Lilian sat apparently unmoved. Her hands were
very cold, but no one knew that. And no one would
ever know how much she had wanted that fellowship.
She had been having a very bad quarter of
an hour since Clara West, who was back as a graduate
student in Greek, managed to find out and let
her know that the decision had been made. Three
times before, Lilian had heard a similar announcement
made, and each time she had thought that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
applause would have been just as loud if the other
possible girl had been named. Now she knew that
there would not have been the same gladness on the
faces or the same heartiness in the hand-clappings
if she had been the one instead of Edith. She
could have made more friends, she believed, but
she had thought that she knew a better use for her
time. A keen heart-longing was mingled with her
disappointment.</p>

<p>A few weeks later the presence of the students in
chapel was again specially requested, and more
announcements were made, among them, that the
Fellowship in History had been given to Lilian
Coles.</p>

<p>"I am so glad!" repeated Clara West that evening,
strolling with Lilian about the campus. That
Lilian was strolling was not without its significance.
It was a misty evening after a rainy day. All about
them were the tender, yet vivid, colours of early
spring&mdash;the fields beyond the edge of the campus,
and the distant uplands, were veiled in green mist.
Near Taylor the Judas-tree was in purple bloom,
and further away the Japanese cherries lifted pink
sprays against a soft grey sky. Lilian was moved
to an appreciation that did not exclude a quality the
picture received from the dignity of the buildings,
or even from the well-kept condition of turf and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
walks. She turned to Clara. "No one can ever
know," she said, "how glad I am to come back."</p>

<p>It was the day before commencement. Lilian
Coles was in the library, selecting some books to
take away for the summer. She went to a window
that looked toward Rosemont and Villa Nova. She
had come to have a sense of wide distances from
this window. For the moment, with a swift,
scarcely-conscious recognition of new ideals, new
standards of life, she felt in herself something of the
triumphant onward rush of the Winged Victory
dominating this end of the library. This morning
the sky was deep blue with a few white clouds.
The air was fresh, the trees and grass very green.
The slope beyond the tennis-courts was white with
daisies. Some professors, in white flannels, were
playing tennis on the nearest courts. Girls in white
duck or fluffy muslins were moving toward the
gymnasium. The college breakfast was to be there
at twelve o'clock. Lilian was going. She had refused
all invitations until her examinations were
over. Then she went to several teas, to a picnic
luncheon and to the class supper. She intended to
go to the alumnæ banquet Thursday evening.</p>

<p>Lilian found her place at one of the long tables in
the gymnasium beside Clara West and opposite
Hester Grey. The balustrade of the running-track<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
had been transformed into a frieze of mountain
laurel. Laurel and ferns decorated the tables.</p>

<p>The breakfast was nearly over, and the black
waiters were serving the ices.</p>

<p>"Can you see Lilian Coles?" Blanche bent
around an intervening neighbour to ask Katherine.
Katherine, happy in the fact that she would get a
degree on the morrow, looked across the tables just
as Lilian touched glasses with a freshman, her
lips moving in the chorus,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here's to Bryn Mawr College!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was Hester Grey who saw a solemn look on
Lilian's face as they rose to join in "Manus Bryn
Mawrensium." But at that moment it seemed to
Lilian herself, that of all the "lætissimæ puellæ"
she, in her way, was the most joyful.</p>

<h2><a name="FREE_AMONG_THE_DEAD" id="FREE_AMONG_THE_DEAD"><i>FREE AMONG THE DEAD</i></a></h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>A quick step came down the hall and stopped.
There was a rustle of silk; the step died away in
the direction from which it came. Esther raised her
head, carefully laying her little clay tablet on its bed
of jeweller's cotton as she wheeled around an instant
to smile:</p>

<p>"They're a bit shy of us to-night, Sydney.
Haven't you finished with Marius?"</p>

<p>Sydney Lodge, who had swung round also and
met her eye, answered:</p>

<p>"No wonder they are; I know I'm shy of myself.
If only for once we lived in Denbigh! Then
we might at least see the Faculty coming down past
the staircase window and the lights going out in
Taylor and know when the meeting was over."
The castors complained as she pushed back her
chair, then the sash went up and the breath of the
night that came in and rattled Esther's papers tasted
like deep well water, wonderfully pure and cool
and dark. Esther wrapped her gown about her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
for since dinner she had been working in the library,
and crossing the study with the very light step of a
very strong person leaned out the window behind
her friend.</p>

<p>There was no moon, and the enormous star-sown
hemisphere whose horizon fell below their feet,
was tonight a faint blur of pearl-grey. Almost as
faint and illusory was the ground, and the other
halls were denoted by pinkish spots and splashes.
From many of these, and in especial from the great
windows of the library, ran bands of moonlight-coloured
light, like a search-light seen transversely,
but filmier. A step rang along the board walk,
crunched the gravel, dying away muffled and uneven
on grass; voices blew up to them from somewhere
and a far-off singing that sounded sweet.
Sydney Lodge shivered a little and was drawn in to
the fire.</p>

<p>"Lie down and scorch your fuzzy head, young
Shelley. The ten o'clock bell hasn't rung and they
won't agree for hours yet."</p>

<p>"They never take long over the graduate fellowships,&mdash;they
put them off, as last year; still, I admit
the senior one is hard to settle," acknowledged
Sydney, mischievously.</p>

<p>Esther answered with joyful appreciation: "This
is quite the most picturesque situation we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
ever in. If you don't get it I shall be comforted by
its being Hilda&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and if Hilda misses it we've all three the
satisfaction of knowing the honour is yours&mdash;all
three, mark you; for it is an honour, you know.
And one of us must get it," finished Sydney with
conviction.</p>

<p>At the door a knock made both girls turn pale,
but as it opened appeared a mermaid-head with
knotted and dripping tresses, just from the swimming-pool,
to beg Sydney's company and her violin
below on the second floor. The invitation declined,
the two were silent awhile.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Sydney, on the grey furry rug, trailed her slim
length closer to the fire like a pale-green enchanted
caterpillar.</p>

<p>"Did you hear Hilda on Marius at dinner?" she
inquired drowsily. "She said if he hadn't stopped
to bury his dead&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's quite right. He is very beautiful but all
wrong, you know. The supreme end of living&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is fullness of life," cut in Sydney. "That's an
axiom, like the being of a feeling is its being felt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and that other, about the <i>esse</i> of a thing's being
<i>percipi</i>. Anyway, he had it, fullness of life. But
it lands you in the Uebermensch, all the same, and
<i>he</i> is a fearful brute."</p>

<p>Mechanically Esther murmured: "Nonsense, the
Uebermensch is the Magnanimous Man, essentially."</p>

<p>"He's not a bit. Anyway, I don't believe you
can work equations like that," replied Sydney,
stretching up one hand pink against the fire. "I
don't think the Magnanimous Man is the opposite
of Marius and I know he isn't the same as the
Uebermensch, even temperamentally. He risked
greatly for great ends: Marius of course never
risked at all but the Uebermensch is always chancing
it for no particular reason. He doesn't go in for
final causes, does he? Please, between them I
prefer the Aristotelian,&mdash;but not to know personally.
It's bound to end in hardness."</p>

<p>"In the last analysis, your soul's your own," declared
Esther with a habitual gesture of wrapping
her gown about her, but the other broke in with a
little cry:</p>

<p>"Ah, but it isn't! It's every one's else, in the last
analysis."</p>

<p>"But it is not really so good in the long run even
for the other people, that <i>Tristem Neminem Fecit</i>.
Remember Jane Barry, what she gave up for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
people; they hadn't a thing against the man, but
they couldn't spare her. Now they have an invalid,
and when I was there at Christmas I noticed a very
real hardness, which wasn't in the least pretty."</p>

<p>Sydney answered with a candour almost noble:
"Really, of course, one should only make great
renouncements on one's deathbed."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that if Marlowe came by to-morrow
and said: 'Chuck the degree, chuck
Sydney there on the hearthrug, and come for a walk
around the world,' I shouldn't go?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you would go, 'still climbing after
knowledge infinite.' But then you've no ties,"
finished Sydney, strong in the recollection of a
father, a mother and several brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>"Don't you call yourself a tie?" laughed Esther.</p>

<p>"I believe you would go," Sydney repeated with
a note of regretful admiration. "Now I pray I
should have grace to reply: 'Thank you kindly, sir,
but I'm bespoke.' I mean, if you had broken your
back, for instance, or gone blind."</p>

<p>In an old oval mirror on the opposite wall Esther
Lawes regarded for an instant her own fair strength,
and the large grey eyes a little too clear and bright
and round; from year to year they used to give out.</p>

<p>"I believe you would," she echoed, gazing down
with her usual pleased sense of Sydney's beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Never did girl better match than Sydney Lodge her
gracious name, radiant, the very sound of it, with
sylvan and romantic suggestions. Her slimness had
the graceless grace of Shakespeare's disguised heroines;
her curls, of hair the most golden red, prompted
the quaint Elizabethan epithet of "gold wires"; and
her academic gown sat as straightly on her as the
Oread's coat of sycamore bark.</p>

<p>"God forbid," said Sydney Lodge solemnly.
"The Powers have a trick now and then of taking
us at our word, and our answered prayers are fruit
bitter in the eating."</p>

<p>While she spoke they became conscious that the
great bell was ringing, with strokes that sounded
now near, now far distant, from every quarter,
rhythmic in their pulse; the first distinct
enough yet echoing familiarly, as though it were
the second or third, the last in like manner seeming
a faint intermediate one, whose successors the ear
had lost. And like the wind awhile before, so the
bell had a tang of darkness and the great spaces
outside.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In the house there were movements, and voices
cut short by banging doors. Sydney had picked
up a lamp and disappeared into her bedroom in a
sphere of radiance, like a glow-worm. The dimmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
room, which seemed yellower, took a new
look: the whole Italian Renaissance, very adequately
represented by the pictures on the walls,
withdrew into itself and darkness. Esther stared
absently from the long steamer chair at the faintly
yellowed walls, at the pink bed of coals, and two
Tanagra figurines above,&mdash;the lady who binds up
her hair and the other lady carrying a wide basin in
her slender hands, who forever bends over it to
watch her own reflected face.</p>

<p>The girl was disturbed more by this fellowship
business than even to her close friend she could betray.
Not wanting the fellowship for herself, she
did crave it for Sydney. Moreover, they could then
go abroad together. She had longed that day to
hint as much to a professor that was, she thought,
disposed to overvalue her own rather advanced
work along a very narrow line as against Sydney's
all-round brilliancy. And while she heard the other
opening drawers and rustling in her wardrobe,
Esther pursued her misgiving a step further than it
had ever before taken her, although at no time was
she a fancier of illusions.</p>

<p>Their alliance, hers and Sydney's, ran back at
least a dozen years, away into childhood, and was
rooted in all sorts of mutual dependencies. Both
moreover were fastidious and constant in their personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
affections, making indeed few acquaintances
but giving up fewer, and although Sydney had
besides what the other called the goose-brigade, a
succession of waddling and hissing creatures of
both sexes that passed for swans, yet these never
got farther than, so to speak, the common outside
her windows. Esther herself, without near relatives
and secure of a tiny income on which one could
starve at least comfortably, having come to college
in the interest less of culture than of pedantry, had
in the interest of amusement supplemented her
Greek with English, and her Hebrew, by way of
serious study, with Assyrian and kindred tongues.
But Sydney, positively, had gone through as many
stages and as well-defined as a silk-worm. Once
her violin was the be-all and the end-all; her
masters had advised a professional training, urged
the expediency of having a career up one's sleeve.
Esther felt that it was she who had unconsciously
lopped off that possibility, in her own enthusiasm
for the college which she was then about
to enter, to which she whirled off her friend,
plumping her down mentally breathless in a field
of Latin and Greek. For the past year or two
years, however, the classical prepossessions had
been yielding to a keener preoccupation with English
and a kindling ambition along the line of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the Sunday papers call literary work. This was
furthered partly by Esther's own growing delight in
the same matters and partly by the influence of
other members of their class, notably Hilda Railton.</p>

<p>It was in the <i>argot</i> of their own vanishing here
and now, of course, that they had been talking,
using counters precisely as the poker-player does,
to stand for an immense amount, or at any rate for
an indefinite amount. Sydney was wonderful at
catching not merely the turn of a phrase, but a turn
of thought: she was <i>simpatica</i>.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said the voice from the inner
room, "I can't get that Japanese thing of Hilda's
out of my head. Don't you think I might look for
one at that same Fifth Avenue place when I am at
home at Easter, and try it over my table?"</p>

<p>Hilda's Japanese print! There you were. After
all, one did recognize the type; it wasn't the superficial
nor yet the parasite, but there was about it
something of the chameleon nature. It was the
ominous unruffled pool that brought Narcissus to
his death. With all her brilliancy, all her charm,
she was in essence simply the magical mirror.</p>

<p>Esther was convinced that neither Sydney herself
knew this, nor any of her neighbours. She was far
and away too clever. There was just one pathetic
chance that somebody in the Faculty might be of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
inconceivable a cleverness as to have spied the unscholastic
fact.</p>

<p>For the third time that evening steps came to the
door, and a knock. Esther waited for Sydney and
the girls moved together to the threshold, opening
on the mistress who held out an envelope. She
offered it to Esther.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Is there any place in the world, Esther Lawes often
in graduate days asked her friends, where the
evening light lies so long and so delicate as at Bryn
Mawr? The campus, snow-piled, prolongs a pale
dusk at tea-time; in spring the afternoons grow
longer slowly until they are forgotten in the softness
of the lengthening evenings; the great cherry-tree,
black against grey Pembroke but afoam and
aflutter with exquisite whiteness, merges its sharp
perfume into the softer odour of the crowded
flushed apple-trees and the pungent flavour of their
neighbours the green-tufted larches. The misty
woods back of Merion become denser aloft and under
foot; and beyond the Roberts Road the meadow
fills up across the brook with pale shapely violets
striped at the heart by threads of purple; the long
avenue of maples shakes out its heavy leafage under
which all day the girls with their rugs and cushions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
make yellow and scarlet splashes. After dinner, on
the dense short turf in front of Denbigh, she would
watch the undergraduates quadrilling&mdash;comely figures
in faint blues and lavenders, ribbons and ruffles
all afloat. She stopped awhile on one of these
bland nights in a late and sudden spring, to scan
the half-familiar types, the sleek heads and white
arms, in the waxing twilight, smiling to herself at
her content with them and with the swirl of voiceless
swallows about one of the high stone chimneys
of Taylor Hall. Gathering up her own filmy dress
she moved through the deep-green grass that began
to dull and chill her slippers, to the shadowed postern
door in the graduate wing and up to her
own study. She had not dreamed of such content,
she remembered, her first night in the room.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>All the days on the steamer she had misdoubted
the return to college after two years' absence, and
the surprise and foreboding that sprang up when
her closest gaze at the dock failed to show her
Sydney Lodge, increased the mistrust. There was
nothing for which to stay over in New York since
Sydney, according to the friends who did show up
to greet her, was still twenty miles off at the seashore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and since Esther had cabled to engage the
graduate suite of rooms for themselves at college
there was a place prepared and probably a letter
awaiting her there. Tired with the bustle of the
custom house, she scarcely noticed the sunburnt
country north of Philadelphia, but from the moment
of pulling out from the city westward, found vague
forgotten recollections stirring like indistinguishable
odours.</p>

<p>Strong enough at last even to satisfy her was the
sense of a glad home-coming and the sudden contraction
of her throat at particular perceptions: the
first glimpses of the bell-tower above the trees, the
stillness of the wind-swept air, the fresh and quiet
beauty of the grey buildings and green turf.</p>

<p>As a simple mood she welcomed the feeling,
prompt of course to pass, but equally prompt to return
and supplant in time inevitable regrets for the
other life now finally renounced.</p>

<p>It looked very gay, soft, desirable, that other life,
while she surveyed the ungarnished and spotless
emptiness of the bare study. On one table lay a
pile of letters, the topmost directed in Sydney's
hand so oddly like her own: a letter puzzling for
the first sheet, then plain enough in its shamefaced
announcement that the writer was engaged to be
married&mdash;had been, indeed, for a month past but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
for some inexplicable reason had not wished Esther
to learn before sailing. "H'm," thought Esther,
"pity I didn't know this!" She looked around at
the two study-tables, two lamps and two armchairs,
almost the whole furniture of the room, and
began to laugh. The stupid chair butting its nose
against the table as maids always will leave study
chairs, taunted her with the unnecessary assurance
that Sydney would never occupy it.</p>

<p>The man in question, curiously enough, Esther
had once known rather well. Her brother had been
in the same class at Harvard, since whose death
some years before she had scarcely seen him. But
she had not heard of his meeting Sydney. He was
a politician by trade, a lawyer by profession. He
belonged in the Middle West.</p>

<p>Esther felt rather sick and very angry; Sydney at
least needn't have made a fool of her! Still, she
<i>could</i> see the comedy.</p>

<p>"Hello!" rang up a fine, strong voice below,
and turning in the window-seat she saw on the
grass brown sturdy Hilda Railton springing off her
bicycle, rather warm and very pleased to see her.
"I'm coming up. My room is down the hall. Let's
have some tea!"</p>

<p>When the kettle had boiled Hilda remarked, as
she shovelled in the tea: "So you're going in for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the Ph. D. after all? I had dreamed you were
strong-minded enough to resist the prevailing superstition.
O Ichabod, Ichabod!"</p>

<p>Esther, laughing, echoed the <i>Ichabod</i> so sincerely
that Hilda was prompted to change her ground and
while she cut cool odorous slices of lemon to ask:</p>

<p>"So Sydney came back after one winter? I
knew she would."</p>

<p>Esther answered rather dryly: "Yes, her family
couldn't spare her."</p>

<p>"Sydney's family!" laughed Hilda, recognizing
the object of hostility. "We all know it. 'Twas
a pretty good year, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Ah, a golden year!"</p>

<p>"I had a notion from your letters last spring you
were staying over there indefinitely. Then wasn't
there a plan about Sydney's going back?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I needed more time. Last year my eyes
played me a horrid trick and I couldn't work at all.
Not even write letters," said Esther grimly. She
had fancied it was because of her inability to answer
that Sydney had written so seldom. "I had in another
way almost as good a year idling about Berlin
and Paris. My dear girl, you've no notion of the
possibilities of idleness! So I quite thought of
staying at the British Museum this winter, even
alone, and finishing what I was at."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Assyrian cylinders still?"</p>

<p>"Always cylinders." This with a sudden sense
of coldness. "The Deluge, and others. But I
changed my mind." Never should any one, her
former roommate least of all, know what had
changed her mind. Actually this was a letter
from Sydney Lodge, written in July and saying in
effect, "I need you rather badly. How soon are
you coming?" She had explained on a post-card
that certain bricks and cylinders ought first to be
deciphered and in the meantime had cabled for the
rooms. She knew&mdash;it was one of the discoveries
of this extraordinary afternoon&mdash;she knew Sydney's
ways even to the point of prediction; that if she
should say: "But my dear child I wrote you I had
engaged the suite for us both," the young lady
would answer with a brilliant smile of privilege and
a new note&mdash;was it the sentimental?&mdash;in her voice:
"Did you really? Well, I must have been thinking
of something else when I read the letter." It
was impossible not to laugh, but Esther covered the
laughter with a sudden inspiration:</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, don't you want to share my study?"</p>

<p>"But Sydney?" cried poor Hilda, setting down
her flowered teacup.</p>

<p>"Sydney's engaged. One Lewis Mason."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" Hilda answered flatly. "I'm rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
sorry. I always believed in her, you know. She
might have done things."</p>

<p>"Presumably one can do things with a husband.
He is supposed to help," replied Esther, throwing
forward her general convictions in the grotesque
struggle for loyalty.</p>

<p>"Ah, she can't. And," added the girl, conclusively,
"he won't."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>Hilda returned violently: "I know the beggar.
She stayed a Sunday with Helen when I was
there this summer and&mdash;he called in the evening.
He's in politics, but quite respectable. I don't know
why I shouldn't come, if you really want me: I'm
taking my Ph. D., too, you know. Think it over.
He's what they called," said Hilda with an explicit
vagueness, "'<i>le parfait gentleman</i>.'"</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Esther looked around, when she went back to the
emptiness, almost with a little shiver. This was
the end then: <i>après tant de jours: après tant de
fleurs</i>. She had just for a little while known the
unacademic world, people who had seen something
different in her face, something rather sweet and
rather sensitive.</p>

<p>How far all the things seemed and all alike how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
dim: the socialist meetings in Berlin, the cheap
dinners at a droll <i>crêmerie</i> in Paris frescoed all
around with the history of the Queen of Hearts and
the immemorial tarts; even the soft after-dinner
hour when she was staying with her cousins down
in Leicestershire; even a delicious painter-boy who
had just got into the Salon&mdash;all alike out of reach.
The life before her looked poor and thin: books to
be sure were at hand and one could hurry up to
New York two or three times in a winter for the
opera, and go abroad every summer with a companion
chosen, like Hilda, expressly for her impersonality,
one year to Greece, another time for the
French cathedrals and <i>châteaux</i>.</p>

<p>Hilda&mdash;"she's impersonal as a Velasquez," she had
written in the first week&mdash;proved for the aggrieved
young woman the Griselda of companions.</p>

<p>Even to herself Esther would only admit a few
grounds of grievance. Sydney did well to marry,
though there were elements of pain in the shock
and the strangeness of her elected husband, but
she, or somebody else, might have sounded a note
of warning. That faint sigh of amorous trouble
and the consequent precipitate response! Esther
found herself in the position of one running at full
speed who stops short, consciously red-faced and
rather blown. The picture made her angry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
undigested anger made her sick and spoiled her
work.</p>

<p>There was even a sense of participation in Sydney's
guilt, a secret confession of some dawdling in
Paris, some philandering, that provoked to wholesome
laughter. She had moments of saying to her
inward interlocutor that it was rather absurd to
chafe at the loss after all of only a few months, in
June she would go back to London, to Paris, to the
great glad world. But these conversations shared
more or less the chimerical character of the thoughts
when one lies awake at night and in the bodily
warmth and darkness and the inner blaze of the
overheated brain, one's perceptions, one's values
are all monstrous. At last she saw that she had
in truth been only playing with the thought of the
straight, brown-bearded young artist in his little
round cap like a Holbein drawing. Him she had
not left behind without annoyance, though certainly
she would not have wished to bring him along; but
she could not even for Sydney have left behind her
lexicons and manuscripts, and comical little bricks
done up in pasteboard jewel boxes.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The moon plainly was coming up in a hurry behind
Dalton as Esther paused at the entrance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
her room, for though still invisible it filled with
light the air outside all the windows. Against
this pale-blue background Hilda on the sill was
making coffee in a tall green porcelain pot. The
air was full of the spicy steam.</p>

<p>"<i>Dégenérée!</i>" laughed Esther. "Didn't you
have coffee for dinner?"</p>

<p>"Dinner was a long time ago," replied Hilda
sententiously. "Besides, I didn't have enough.
Where have you been? Your frock is clammy."</p>

<p>"In the Harriton family graveyard, first, sitting
on the steps over the wall and listening to a woodthrush.
Did you ever have enough?" Esther
added, lighting a lamp as she spoke, while the
brass teakettle winked in the soft light and the
outside earth vanished. "Hilda, it's a good
world."</p>

<p>"A well-enough world," answered Hilda crossing
the yellow patch to get the delicate cups. As
she returned with them Esther studied her black
serge skirt and caught it up.</p>

<p>"Cat-hairs!" she affirmed. "How was Helen?&mdash;I've
not seen her for a long time. And how was
Pasht? He has a black soul."</p>

<p>"He's uncommonly beautiful. If you go to
Chapel to-morrow," said Hilda irrelevantly, "you
will hear the President announce that I am appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
a Reader in English for next year. Pretty
good, isn't it, for a Canadian who is Scotch?"</p>

<p>"That's all right, Doctor Railton," murmured
Esther congratulating her and adding, "Then I'm
sure of you here next year." This was before the
days of Low Buildings, and Readers lived in the
Halls where and how they could.</p>

<p>Esther lay back in her chair, admiring the tarnished
frame of a quaint oval mirror that reflected a
really admirable Japanese water-colour of Hilda's.
She was glad the study would be unchanged another
year, and quiet. She thought, too, with a
little shudder of the hot bad air of crowded rooms,
the loud noise of voices, the indecorous bustle of a
life made up of many acquaintances.</p>

<p>"I am going to Spain this summer to look at
some Arabic manuscripts," she said at length.
"You'd better come too. If we cross cheaply and
don't travel we can live on nothing. Berenson says
the Spanish galleries are full of wonderful pictures,
practically unknown."</p>

<p>"My dear, I've a family," laughed Hilda ruefully.</p>

<p>"Didn't you say last night that they were going
to the winds of heaven this year and that you didn't
know what to do? Represent to them, moreover,
that one shouldn't lose so superb a chance of <i>doing</i>
me. Seriously, I shall take a whole stateroom, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
having forgotten the seasick German girl I came
home with last time, and you'd much better occupy
the other berth. Indeed, I can't travel alone in
Spain, you know."</p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed on eighteen square inches of
pinkish brocade pinned against the wall&mdash;her Christmas
present to Hilda and a ruinous extravagance.
A chance word, from a lecture, she had caught up
and fancied once, came back: "Nobody frames
the multiplication table and hangs it on the wall."
But surely that was because the multiplication table
was shallow and petty and strikingly untrue: there
were tracts of knowledge infinite and unfathomable
where one would never tire.</p>

<p>The things, she realized, which one does not ask
too much of&mdash;and the people&mdash;are the things which
are forever surprising one with unguessed possibilities.</p>

<p>"Curiosity, after all, is the only insatiable emotion,"
said Esther out of her experience, and there
were always more little bricks: one might even in
time when one had read all the rest, go and dig
some up with one's own hands.</p>

<p>The great bell clangs out through the morning
air&mdash;through the snowflakes that thicken it, sending
its summons over the white-crusted campus.
The slippery walks are crowded with black figures
moving towards Taylor Hall, single, in groups of
twos and threes, wrapped close with shawls and
hoods, half of them umbrellaless. Voices fall as
they enter and amid friendly jostling around the
bulletin board and in the cloak-room whispered
greetings are exchanged. Then upstairs to the
silent chapel, with its white windows made whiter
by the frost; a stillness seeming to fold it round.
The black mortar-boards nod their tassels in cheery
greeting; subdued talk between neighbours fills the
room with a low hum. A sudden hush; the talk
stops; the heads are still; a moment's pause and
the service has begun. All are together for once in
the day, with no distinctions of class or grade. All
are alike children, and children of Bryn Mawr. At
the close of the prayer another moment's silence.
Then a sudden movement. The bell clangs out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
again. A general rush to classes, to the office, to
one's room. The day has begun.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sunlight is streaming in through the broad
windows. It dances among the leaves of the red
geraniums on the window-sill and falls upon the
carpet in bright spots and bands. The bookcase
and the two shelves of the little mahogany desk are
crowded with a confusion of much worn, many-coloured
volumes. Over the Dresden inkstand
and disordered files of papers and pencils a small
brass dragon mounts guard. Dainty cups shine on
the white tea-table, which bears for its motto the
words of the March Hare:</p>

<p>"<i>It's always tea-time, and we've no time to wash
the tea things between whiles.</i>"</p>

<p>On the Turkish scarf which drapes the mantel
stands a ginger-jar full of yellow roses. Across
the rocking-chair is thrown a college gown, while
tennis balls and rackets strew the floor. The divan
is filled with flowered cushions innumerable, and
half-buried among them is the mistress of all this
colour and confusion. She is reading "The Republic."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a warm afternoon in May. The shadows
were lengthening on the campus, and the air had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
all the stillness of midsummer. On the grass near
the gravel walk a robin was hopping and pecking.
Two black-gowned figures had just passed slowly
by, and now all was still again. A sparrow who
had been hovering for several minutes over head
alighted close by the robin.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the robin, "could you but fancy
what you have lost! Two seniors conversing together.
Did you not perceive them?"</p>

<p>The sparrow would gladly have concealed his
ignorance on such classic ground, yet, constrained
by curiosity, with hanging head he asked, "What
may seniors be?"</p>

<p>"Seniors," replied the robin. "Do you not
know, then, that seniors are the sovereigns of this
place? Indeed, I assure you, it is true. We have
their own confession for it. Listen while I tell you
the words of these two as they passed by.</p>

<p>"'Well, it is almost over,' said one. 'And next
year what do you suppose will become of the college?'</p>

<p>"'It is too dreadful to think of,' said the other.
'Some of our class may come back as graduates.
That is the only hope.'</p>

<p>"'And even then they cannot help the Undergraduate
Association. And they will be too few to
manage Self-Government. Oh, this dear old college!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
It is too terrible to think of leaving it to go
to rack and ruin. And just when everything is in
the best condition possible! Imagine the Editorial
Board without some member from '93! And the
standard of class work is sure to fall next year.'</p>

<p>"'And the gymnasium, too. To be sure most
of us are making up conditions in the gym, but
then&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Oh, there is no help for it! The college is
sure to go down now. And it has been rapidly
rising for four years! It is too cruel!'"</p>

<p>The robin paused. Then he hopped confidingly
towards the sparrow and, cocking his head on one
side, whispered, "If you will take the trouble to
listen you will hear conversations like that every
spring on this campus. Now you know what
seniors are."</p>

<h2><a name="EPOCH_MAKING" id="EPOCH_MAKING"><i>EPOCH MAKING</i></a></h2>


<p>The morning after the freshman play found the
gymnasium looking somewhat forlorn. The portable
stage had lost part of the discreet drapery that
masked its front below the footlights, and now
recklessly displayed its crazy supports to the public
eye; the footlights themselves were a mass of
blackened tallow in their battered tin sockets; the
faded green canton-flannel curtains which had
served as a forest background for the last act of
<i>Prince Otto</i>, and been torn from half their rings at
its end when Seraphina and the prince tried to make
a simultaneous entry in response to applause, trailed
limply from their remaining supports, and seemed
to beg for the friendly shadows of the property-room
to hide their rents and tatters. In the corners
of the stage, the groups of branches which had
simulated the primeval forest drooped their withered
heads in mournful wise against their too evident
props, and like the grey cambric rocks and tin-foil
rivulet which occupied the centre of the scene, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
hardly recognizable as parts of last night's fairy
woodland.</p>

<p>Even less recognizable, but scarcely so forlorn,
the actors in the performance soon began to drop
in, at first one by one, and then in little groups of
two or three. They came in fresh and smiling and
full of misdirected zeal for the work of clearing up;
most of the later arrivals came from the basket-ball
field, and flung down their gayly-coloured golf-capes
just where they would be most in the way; and all
of them, as they went about pulling down the decorations,
and piling borrowed properties into bewildering
heaps for return to their owners, chattered
incessantly of last night's great success.</p>

<p>The November sunlight fell in yellow, dusty
shafts through the high windows above the running
track, spilling its pale brightness on the cluttered
floor and stage, and spread even into the alcove
where the horizontal bars jostled the horse and the
rowing-machines in ignominious confusion and
with a general shamefaced air of being huddled out
of the way. The position of the yellow rays indicated
ten o'clock, and the busy workers, having accumulated
rugs, curtains, costumes, bric-a-brac, a
number of potted plants, and the fragments of a
pasteboard fireplace, in heterogeneous piles on
every side, were beginning to wonder if they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
ever straighten them out again, when the arrival of
three or four fresh recruits gave them an excuse for
resting while they reported progress.</p>

<p>Their labours, indeed, spoke for themselves.
Peggy Dillon, the class chairman, who headed the
reinforcements, opened her round blue eyes aghast
at the dusty chaos which greeted her, and found
herself bereft of speech by the look of modest pride
which beamed from all the faces before her; but
one of her companions, a handsome girl with a certain
air of authority about her, was equal to the
occasion.</p>

<p>"Dear me, how enterprising you all are!" she
exclaimed, coming forward with a comprehensive
smile; "there is really a great deal accomplished
already. (Don't look so utterly overcome, Peggy,
if you can help it.) You must have worked like
beavers to get all those curtains down."</p>

<p>The workers, hot, dirty, and dishevelled, beamed
with redoubled brightness upon the speaker, and
upon the havoc they had wrought, and tasted all
the sweetness of being appreciated. Pauline Van
Sandford was a tall girl who carried her head rather
high, and spoke with a good-humoured imperiousness.
Perhaps these things added weight to her remarks.
With a very creditable show of gratification,
she went on,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"And nearly all the properties in piles!" Here
a gasp from Peggy, who had just discovered her
pet cast in one of the said piles under a section of
the stage-steps, warned her to hasten her climax;
she worked up her remarks to quite an enthusiastic
close, and then, apparently consumed with anxiety
for the workers' fatigue, she fell upon the helpful
band, and fairly swept them from the gymnasium
upon a wave of appreciative solicitude.</p>

<p>"Do go home and lie down, all of you&mdash;no, it's
really too much to expect&mdash;no, don't think of staying,
we can do all the rest&mdash;no, you are too good,
and we are awfully grateful, but&mdash;there!" She
slammed the door upon the bewildered objects of
her gratitude, and then, falling back against it, exchanged
looks of despair with her companions.</p>

<p>"Who would ever have thought they'd get at it
so early!" wailed Peggy, on her knees beside a
particularly hopeless-looking heap of articles; "will
some one help me to rescue my poor Clytie? Shirley,
lend a hand with these steps."</p>

<p>Shirley Nairn, a slender girl with a big, soft, dust-brown
pompadour, brown eyes, and a firm little
chin which half contradicted their gentleness, began
cautiously to lift away the boards. She had a fluttering
grace in all her movements like that of a bird
just lighting. "Rescue is the word," she said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
"there is still hope for most of the things, but unless
we do a lot before lunch, those Vandals will be
back again, and next time there will be nothing left
but chips."</p>

<p>In spite of the discouraging outlook, an hour or
two of hard work did wonders. Curtains and costumes
went to the property-room, the faded forest
hid its head in a corner, the borrowed chairs and
rugs and rubber-plants found themselves grouped
in something like order, and the rescue party sank
at last upon a mattress in the alcove to wipe its
heated brow, and survey results.</p>

<p>"There is less damage done than you would
think," observed Katharine Holland; she was a girl
of that ineffectual type that must always appeal to
some one, and she now turned her long brown face
and mournful eyes towards Shirley. "Except for
Peggy's Clytie, and a few smashed pots, and that long
tear in Miss Meredith's leopard-skin, most things
seem to have been miraculously spared. There is a
special Providence that watches over idiots."</p>

<p>Still inspecting her very grimy hands, Shirley
said, "They aren't really idiots, but you can't leave
them to themselves. We should have had a committee."</p>

<p>"It's all my fault; I neglected it," began Peggy
meekly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are all just as bad," Pauline interrupted in a
decided tone; "Louise is stage manager, and I am
business manager, and look at our behaviour: we
have both been wasting valuable time on our essay
appointments when we should have been attending
to business."</p>

<p>As self-accusation seemed the order of the day,
each of the small party came forward to blame herself,
and did it thoroughly and at some length.
When a soothing pause came at last, Shirley said
meditatively,</p>

<p>"I heard Miss Meredith say the other day that
women couldn't work together effectively, because
woman isn't a political animal."</p>

<p>Charlotte Meredith's masters degree and undisputed
cleverness gave no small weight to her
opinion among the undergraduates, but Pauline, as
her cousin and protégée, stood less in awe of her
than most of the freshmen; she had even dared to
christen her, quite openly, "the Cynic." It was
Pauline, therefore, who now voiced the meeting's
dissent from Miss Meredith's dictum. Woman
could be a political animal, if she chose, and was
properly directed. All that the class of '9&mdash; needed
was to be taught to think before they acted.</p>

<p>Louise Ferguson, a small bustling girl with red
hair, wanted to know how you were going to teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
them to think. They might be able to do it
separately, but when you took them in the mass,
they were just like a flock of sheep, and class meetings
merely a game of follow-my-leader. No
matter how clever and sensible the individual girl
was, a class of sixty-three girls was capable of any
idiocy on the spur of the moment. "Look at the
number of classes who elect their presidents, and
then hate them ever after. Look at the case of the
class who barred out their temporary chairman,
and then spent the rest of their college career wishing
they had elected her. They never know what
they want, or if they do, they don't know enough
to get it."</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," crowed Peggy; "all the
bouquets are coming my way. '9&mdash; made me chairman,
therefore they did not want me. Q. E. D.
Thanks ever so much!"</p>

<p>As Louise and Peggy were roommates, their differences
could be left for private settlement. Louise
therefore took no notice of this interruption,
beyond a threatening scowl at the speaker, and,
sticking bravely to her point, appealed to Pauline
for support. In Pauline's opinion class politics were
usually unintelligent, but she did not agree that
there was no help for it. When the spirited discussion
which this remark brought on had run its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
rather ineffectual course to no conclusion, the two
disputants fell silent, and four of the little group
found themselves looking shyly at Shirley Nairn.</p>

<p>Three of the girls had come up together from the
Airlie School in New York, and Pauline Van Sandford
was their leader; Peggy Dillon was a Philadelphia
girl who had chanced upon a room in the
"Airlie corridor" of Pembroke East, and whose
short-lived ascendency in '9&mdash;'s affairs had declined,
very early in her chairmanship, into dependence
upon Pauline; but Shirley Nairn lived in
Merion, and the four knew very little about her, except
that her schoolmates from the Briony School of
New Haven counted on her to win the class
presidency from the Airlie candidate. So now
they eyed her sideways, and waited for her views
on class politics as expressing class intelligence; and
the pause was just beginning to be uncomfortable
when she lifted her head.</p>

<p>"We might try to better things in our own
case," she said tentatively; "there ought to be a
way to make class politics intelligent, but we can
only prove it by doing it."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Louise, while Pauline rapidly
decided that Shirley Nairn did not have that square
chin for nothing. Then, taking the floor herself,
Pauline opined that the whole trouble lay in too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
hasty action. "We women," she said, rather
grandly, and with her usual air of decided conviction,
"we women make up our minds before we
think; we look at a few arguments, listen to our
friends' opinions, leap to a conclusion (usually all
wrong), and score another foolish vote."</p>

<p>Peggy's groan of mock despair, which followed
this speech, and was meant to preface a lively protest,
was robbed of effect by the sudden sound of
Taylor bell, ringing for lunch-time; and the parliament
of five forthwith dissolved. But as they dispersed,
Pauline pledged them all to come to her
room that evening for further discussion of the
subject. They met there accordingly, with a few
other high souls who were ripe for reform; they
discussed; and from their discussion there grew a
plan.</p>

<p>When the class of '9&mdash; assembled a few days
later in Denbigh Students' Parlour, they expected to
nominate and forthwith elect their permanent officers;
but on the latter point a considerable surprise
was in store for them. After the nomination votes
for president were cast and counted, and the result
announced&mdash;Shirley and Pauline far in the lead, and
very close together, Peggy a modest third, and a
few other names straggling hopelessly in the rear&mdash;the
chairman rose to tell them that a change in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
usual order of proceedings was proposed. The
nominations for president were now before them;
the election was postponed, by order of the chair,
until that day week, in order that during the interval
the class might weigh well its measures before
taking the final&mdash;Peggy's tone almost implied, the
fatal&mdash;step. In the stupefied silence which followed
this announcement, she went on to give the
arguments in favour of the new course. It would
give them time to look into the qualifications of the
candidates and form their decision intelligently; it
would prevent mistakes which they might deplore
hereafter; and&mdash;superbly&mdash;it would mark the beginning
of a new epoch in class politics. The
candidates were bound in honour not to canvass for
themselves, or to allow others to do so, and the
final ballot was to be cast according to each voter's
conviction of what would be best for the class. No
haste in deciding, no prejudice, no regard to personal
influence; but careful consideration, and final
action on the highest and most disinterested
grounds&mdash;that was the idea.</p>

<p>When the other nominations were in, and the
meeting adjourned, the class of '9&mdash; went its various
ways homeward sorely bewildered. It does not do,
as a rule, to call upon a freshman class for too much
disinterested consideration when it is just recovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
from the effects of a freshman play; but the
undergraduate mind will usually rise to a hook that
is baited with the word "epoch-making." So the
members of '9&mdash; eager to make an epoch, fell very
earnestly and ardently to work at the business of
weighing and comparing the two chief candidates
before them; Peggy's name was very little under
discussion, for her chances were hardly to be considered
seriously, and, as interest centred in the
presidency, the candidates for other offices got very
little attention. But concerning the merits and demerits
of Shirley and Pauline, the course of debate
ran high and warm; during the seven days assigned
them, the freshmen talked of little else, and
strove hard to prove, by quite a heated exhibition
of partisan spirit, that they were political animals
after all, while the two principal nominees affected
an Olympian indifference to the result, and used a
dignified reserve when greeting each other in the
corridors of Taylor. And amused upper classmen
made laughing guesses as to the outcome of the campaign.</p>

<p>But the new plan did not work exactly as its
framers had expected, and in a day or two there
were rumours that things were going wrong. By
the middle of the week these rumours had gathered
such strength that Charlotte Meredith, M. A., and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Fellow of Bryn Mawr College, felt called upon to
visit her freshman cousin, and hear the news. Accordingly
she knocked at the door of 39 Pembroke
East on the afternoon of the fifth day following the
nominations. Charlotte Meredith, whom Pauline
called the Cynic, was a tall, slight girl, pale and
clean-looking, with quantities of very black hair;
she had bright, near-sighted grey eyes behind her
glasses, and walked with a stoop; her usual expression
was one of whimsical boredom. There was
probably no one in the world whom Pauline would
have cared less to see at her door that afternoon,
but she welcomed the unexpected guest with almost
her usual readiness, and tried to cover the real
hollowness of her greeting by eager hospitality in
the line of tea and jam. Peggy was there, too,
spreading crackers with a worried air; and both
girls seemed somewhat harassed by Charlotte's
questions as to the outlook for the election, delivered
with her habitual slight drawl and air of
fatigued politeness.</p>

<p>"I take a lively interest in it," she told them, in a
tone expressive of anything rather than liveliness, as
she stirred her tea; "and I hope you won't let the
fact that you are both candidates embarrass you.
This impersonal campaign of yours is highly novel,
and your effort to elevate class politics into a thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
of moral beauty smacks delightfully of altruism, but
may I ask how the thing is likely&mdash;in the vulgar
phrase&mdash;to pan out?" She nibbled her cracker appreciatively,
and gave the discomfited pair a questioning
smile. Peggy squirmed a little, and said
nothing; but Pauline burst out,</p>

<p>"The whole affair is too miserable and humiliating
for words, and has panned out like&mdash;like&mdash;Charlotte,
it is literally past speech! I am ashamed
of belonging to such a small-minded sex, for the
girls have acted abominably."</p>

<p>Charlotte smiled benignly. "As I understand
that your reform is in part a crusade against a statement
of mine that woman is not a political animal,
would you mind telling me whether their abominableness
throws any light on that point?"</p>

<p>"Political animals?" cried Pauline; "I should say
they were! If we have a rag of reputation left by
the end of the week, I shall be surprised."</p>

<p>"And by 'we' you mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shirley Nairn and myself; Peggy seems to have
been spared."</p>

<p>"Yes," Peggy assented with the utmost affability,
"they are after bigger game, thank Heaven!" And
then, the flood-gates being opened, Charlotte was
favoured with a full, if not very coherent account
of '9&mdash;'s enormities. Events had taken a course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
which was not to be wondered at. In the ranks of
'9&mdash;, deliberation had brought on discussion, discussion
had led to dispute; and in the clash of warring
factions, each side had brought so many charges of
unfitness against the opposing candidate that Pauline
declared her own character, as well as Shirley's,
blackened for life.</p>

<p>"That is doing fairly well for a purely impersonal
campaign not yet five days old," was Charlotte's
grim comment; "I suppose you do not lack for
friends to keep you posted on the state of public
opinion."</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Meredith," responded Peggy
genially, "the only reason that the door is not at
this moment besieged with news from the seat of
war is that the rest of the class are at freshman
drill, which Pauline and I are sinfully cutting. Only
think, Polly, how their tongues are wagging even
now! And how&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A resounding knock at the door cut her short.</p>

<p>"There!" she groaned resignedly, "drill must be
over. Come in!" And as the three turned towards
the door, Pauline said savagely, "Here come all my
dearest friends!"</p>

<p>But it was Shirley Nairn who pushed the door
open, and at sight of Charlotte stopped doubtfully
on the threshold. Over her shoulder, they saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
frightened face of Katharine Holland. Shirley was
looking at Pauline.</p>

<p>"I have something rather important to say," she
said; "it concerns us both, and"&mdash;she hesitated
for a barely appreciable second&mdash;"and no one else.
Except Miss Holland," frigidly, with a glance over
her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, come in, come in!" cried Pauline, "and if
it is about this wretched election, let us have it out.
Charlotte and Peggy know the worst, I think.
Come in."</p>

<p>Shirley advanced, and Katharine shrinkingly followed
her; the uneasy air of the latter, and her
apprehensive looks, made Charlotte sit up with an
expression of interest.</p>

<p>"The plot thickens," she soliloquized to her teacup;
and Pauline, hearing her, knit her brows impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said rather shortly to Shirley.
Her tone brought a flush to the other's cheek; she
hesitated for another moment, and then said
coldly,</p>

<p>"Miss Holland will explain."</p>

<p>Upon being brought thus abruptly into prominence,
Katharine Holland silently besought them all
for mercy with her shamed eyes; then, urged by a
monitory look from Shirley, who leaned beside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
table in frozen silence, she brought out a foolish
and pitiable tale. It was simply an account of
various silly slanders, some directed against Shirley,
and others against Pauline, with which she confessed
she had regaled a company of upper classmen,
apparently only to amuse them; and she interrupted
her confession with weak excuses, like a
guilty child. In her humiliation she made an
uncomfortable spectacle, but Shirley said sternly,
"Finish."</p>

<p>"Oh, let her be!" cried Pauline, impatient of the
scene; "who cares to hear all this? We know it
already."</p>

<p>"There is one thing yet," said Shirley, "but I
will tell it myself; I made her tell all the rest,
so that you might know whether you ought
to take her word against me. She has accused
me of going about to ask for votes." The
speaker's tone was stout enough, but she leaned
heavily on the table, "so I brought her here to retract
it."</p>

<p>Stung by a generous indignation, Pauline sprang
to her feet. "Would you have believed that of
me?" she cried. "She need not trouble to retract
it." Then, turning to Katharine, "That is quite
enough, Miss Holland," she said, and the penitent
stumbled to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>As the door closed upon her, Charlotte, who
had finished her tea in silence, put down her cup
with an air of decision, and turning to Shirley, said
suddenly,</p>

<p>"Wasn't it a little hard on her, Miss Nairn?"</p>

<p>"To punish her for telling a campaign lie?" demanded
Shirley.</p>

<p>"Please leave the campaign out of the question
for a moment. She doesn't seem particularly venomous;
don't you think she deserved a little
mercy?"</p>

<p>"She is a poor creature," said Shirley setting her
lips, "and deserves nothing."</p>

<p>"She is a poor creature," Charlotte assented in
her easy drawl, "whom you have made poorer by
the loss of her self-respect. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because she lied about us," retorted Pauline,
rushing in to defend their joint position.</p>

<p>"Would you even have given her lies a thought,"
asked her cousin with a little more animation, "if
they hadn't interfered with your precious campaign?
You have just made her pay for your own
mistake in attempting the impossible; you began
by trying impersonality in politics, and you have
ended by humiliating a classmate for indulging in
a few exaggerated personalities at your expense.
Is it very consistent?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Struck dumb by surprise at this attack, Pauline
did not answer, but Shirley broke in, with hot
cheeks,</p>

<p>"It was a case of self-defence, Miss Meredith."</p>

<p>Charlotte, as she rose to go, smiled complete
comprehension into the younger girl's troubled
eyes; it was easy to see that the rivals already
valued each other's good opinion beyond the votes
of the class, and she scented fresh developments.
"They won't be a bad team," she decided on her
way home.</p>

<p>Her departure left the other three somewhat at a
loss for words, but Shirley, with an evident effort,
broke the uncomfortable silence.</p>

<p>"We've made a mistake somewhere," she said
hopelessly, "and everything has gone miserably
wrong; but I hope you will believe that I meant
well, even in bringing Katharine Holland here."
And she turned towards the door.</p>

<p>"Don't go," said Pauline; "sit down, and have
some tea." Then seeing that the other hesitated,
"You know that I don't care a rap about those
tales, and I know that you don't either," she said,
stoutly. "I am glad that you came. Won't you
please stay?"</p>

<p>Peggy, who had been absorbed in circumventing
the treacherous tendencies of her jam-sandwich,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
emerged victorious from the struggle to say soothingly,</p>

<p>"Nobody ever believes campaign lies, anyway."</p>

<p>"Except the voters," was Shirley's dry response,
as she dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>During the next half-hour, both Pauline and Shirley
announced their unalterable intention of withdrawing
from the race; each declared that, for the
good of the class, the other ought to be president,
but neither would consent to her rival's retiring, so
that, as Peggy said, the only way out was for both
to stay in. The debate ended in a decision to abide
the issue, and ignore the slanderous tongues, whereupon
they parted much uplifted in spirit, and were
very solemn at dinner that night, as befitted noble-hearted
victims who suffered for their efforts to elevate
their kind.</p>

<p>On the evening before the election, Charlotte
Meredith caught Shirley in the act of waylaying an
Airlie freshman in the hall. Her victim, in gymnasium
dress, with her mask and foil, was evidently
overdue at a fencing-lesson, and anxious to be off,
but Shirley was pitiless, and pinned her to the spot,
while she discoursed at length.</p>

<p>"The impersonal campaign is still on, I see,"
murmured Charlotte, as she passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Shirley's face blazed. "I was telling her the
truth as to some lies about Pauline," she flashed out,
and then looked as if she could have bitten her
tongue for speaking.</p>

<p>The freshman, grateful for an interruption, escaped.</p>

<p>"You needn't have told me that you were canvassing
for Pauline, any more than Pauline needed
to tell me this morning, when I met her coming out
of a Briony girl's room, that she was canvassing for
you. A fine consistent pair you are! But it won't
make any difference," she added, darkly, with a
return to her usual whimsical manner.</p>

<p>The evening of the election buried the reform
fathoms deep; for Peggy was elected president.
When the little band of reformers entered the
students' parlour, where the class was already assembled,
they received the impression of a huddled
flock of sheep, with lowered heads at bay. The
evening's proceedings deepened this impression.
The class of '9&mdash; was worried and bewildered and
disgusted; it had travailed in the throes of indecision
until it sickened of both alternatives, and fell,
like many another, upon the middle course. That
course was the choice of Peggy, astonished Peggy,
by an overwhelming majority in the good old
follow-my-leader fashion; while Pauline and Shirley
watched their airy fabric of reform topple to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
ruin, and then talked of other things during the
counting of the votes.</p>

<p>Charlotte Meredith laughed over the result with
the rest of the on-lookers, but, rather surprisingly,
took the part of the would-be reformers, after a
subtle fashion of her own. "After all," she remarked,
with an air of elaborate deference to a
loudly critical sophomore, "even you and I, Miss
West, were freshmen once." And Miss West
turned a slow red, and refrained from speech.</p>

<p>It was Charlotte's custom to have her freshman
cousin at most of her small teas, so Pauline found
nothing remarkable in the appearance, about this
time, of a small card on her table, reading, "Tea at
five. C. M."; but it was embarrassingly unusual
to find in her cousin's study, not the expected circle
of graduates, with a senior or two, but only Charlotte
herself and Shirley Nairn. The two guests
were duly regaled with tea and bonbons by Miss
Meredith, who, ignoring late events, tried to put
them at their ease. In her whimsical way, she
liked them both. There was, however, a spark of
covert amusement in her eyes as she passed the teacups;
and Pauline, writhing inwardly under this
satirical observation, finally came out with:</p>

<p>"I suppose you were pleased with the result of
our campaign."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Naturally," said Charlotte blandly. "One likes
to have a guess confirmed&mdash;and I was sure of the
result; in that way I was pleased. And you?"</p>

<p>Pauline, playing with her teacup, remarked that
people weren't usually pleased with having made
fools of themselves. Her tone asked for a contradiction,
but it did not come, and the three sat silent,
listening to the singing of the kettle over the spirit-flame,
until Shirley said abruptly:</p>

<p>"Miss Meredith, you were right about the political
animals."</p>

<p>Charlotte raised her eyebrows enquiringly, but
was perhaps not surprised by what she heard; she
may have already reflected that defeat, always hard
to bear, comes in its most unbearable form when it
makes its victims ridiculous. Shirley and Pauline,
having been baulked by very small means in a
project of mighty import, had a galling sense of the
absurdity of their position, and were bitterly ready
to turn on their ungrateful classmates. Therefore
Charlotte had the satisfaction of seeing them come
over to her point of view with exaggerated enthusiasm.
They could not put too strongly the impossibility
of any attempt to educate women politically;
they thought that a few&mdash;a very few, they sadly
added&mdash;might be trusted for public-spirited and disinterested
action; but the mass of women were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
large-minded enough to rise above personal
considerations.</p>

<p>"What other considerations did the poor things
have, in your case?" asked their hostess. "A
class president's duties are not so weighty that she
needs any distinguished qualifications, and the
choice is simply a matter of personal liking. You
insisted on a week's analysis of personal likes and
dislikes, and the natural result was exaggeration
and slander."</p>

<p>The freshmen sat in crestfallen silence. They
had acknowledged their defeat; must they now
acknowledge that it was deserved? Putting down
her plate and leaning a little forward in her chair,
Charlotte regarded them earnestly.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you something," she said; "I have
not lived in college six years for nothing; I have
learned a great deal in that time; but it did not take
me six years to learn not to waste my energy on
trifles. In this campaign of yours, you have used
up an amount of force which would have accomplished
wonders in a serious cause. Has it
paid?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," they said.</p>

<p>"It is an odd thing, too," said Charlotte, in a
casual tone, "to notice that in nine cases out of ten
the popular instinct is a safer guide than the popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
reason. Your class reasoned itself into a frenzy,
and then, by instinct, did the right thing."</p>

<p>At this unexpected tribute to their conqueror, the
two vanquished leaders looked a bit blank; perhaps
they had nursed a faint egotistical hope of some
day seeing the class brought to a realizing sense of
its mistake in electing Peggy, and Charlotte's view
was a blow. She saw the effect of her words.</p>

<p>"They did the right thing," she repeated, "in
choosing a girl who will be an excellent figurehead
for&mdash;a coalition&mdash;" Charlotte smiled, a little self-complacently;
she rather prided herself on the sensitiveness
of her feeling for things that were in the
air&mdash;"a public-spirited, disinterested&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" pleaded Shirley; "I am sick of it.
We have been talking awful cant, haven't we?"</p>

<p>"Suppose we talk about that," said Charlotte.</p>

<p>And they did. They talked about it until the late
sunlight faded, and twilight came down on the
little study; and then, in the gathering gloom, they
talked about it still, and all the more freely. The
older girl, who had tilted with windmills in her
time, opened her heart to these young Quixotes,
fresh from their first fall, on the difference between
cant and college spirit; and the two freshmen, sitting
in the twilight with tingling cheeks, pledged
themselves silently to the larger vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>As they wended their way homeward across the
dusky campus, they were very silent; when Pauline
spoke once, it was only to say, "I am sorry I
called her the Cynic."</p>

<p>And Charlotte, watching their dark receding
forms as she leaned from her open window, hoped
that she hadn't been preaching. It was the old, old
antithesis between enthusiasm and experience; and
after all there was much to be said for enthusiasm.
Those two youngsters had brought something out
of their mischance, if it was only their liking for
each other. "I wish I were a freshman again,"
sighed Charlotte to the stars.</p>

<h2><a name="A_REMINISCENCE" id="A_REMINISCENCE"><i>A REMINISCENCE</i></a></h2>


<p>We had met, after two years or so out in the
"wide, wide world" of which we had sung so
dolefully, the last weeks of senior year. I discovered
that Evelyn had substituted soft "fluffs" for
the stiff collars she had clung to tenaciously through
four years of college, and she admitted that after
the first shock she quite liked the new way I did
my hair. Later she also admitted that she made a
practice of carrying a parasol, or even of wearing a
hat, when it was excessively sunny. Emboldened
by the confession, I ventured to produce some embroidery
and went to work as if such femininity had
always been my pose. Then we talked, and exchanged
various bits of news about the members
of the class who had wandered so far since our
separation.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it sad about Janet?" I asked at last.
And then as Evelyn kept silent, I went on, "you
knew, didn't you?&mdash;She died last November just a
little while after her engagement was announced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
It was typhoid fever. I thought you knew, of
course."</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew," said Evelyn, and went on examining
the bookcase.</p>

<p>"I think I'll tell you about it," she exclaimed at
last. "It won't do any good. But I think I'd like
to tell you. You know Janey and I were awfully
good friends while she was at college. We even
thought of rooming together, but we were both so
well satisfied with our single suites that we decided
not to. We were almost like roommates, though.
Janet always saw that I was registered when I
went home and I always stole rolls for her when
she was locked out from breakfast. We wore each
other's clothes indiscriminately. I have one of her
handkerchiefs yet. You know how it was. We
were just awfully good friends."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;Janet would do anything under the
sun for any one she liked&mdash;go on."</p>

<p>"Well, then she left college. She didn't like it&mdash;one
bit. She was perfectly frank and said she
wanted to come out before she was twenty. Do
you know how it is in those western towns? They
think a girl is antique when she's twenty-one. She
came out and was a great success, I believe. You
know how she stopped writing to first one, then another
of us, and we were all rather hurt about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, she <i>was</i> a disappointment. I had always
thought her so superbly loyal, and we heard that
she said college was 'such a bore.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believed that too, but not until I had
written several letters after she had stopped. Finally
I gave up and thought I'd never hear from her
again. I felt pretty bitter about it. At last she
wrote me and told me of her engagement. Just the
real old Janey, it was&mdash;called me by some absurd
nickname she'd invented, confessed that she'd been
horrid about not writing, and then said that
although the engagement wasn't to be announced
immediately, she wanted me to be one of the first
to know, and would I congratulate her?"</p>

<p>"When was this?" I asked, after a pause.
Evelyn had seized my scissors and seemed to be
too much interested in snipping ends of embroidery
silk to remember Janet or me, or any one else.
She dropped the scissors and took up a book of
college kodaks. I repeated my question, just to
remind her that I was still there.</p>

<p>She turned her back and went on. "That was
some time in May. It came to me at a most unpropitious
time. Some member of the family had
been ill and I was tired and cross and feeling unjustifiably
righteous. So I sat down then and there
and told poor old happy Janet how nice and high-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
I had been about writing and how unfriendly
she had been. I said of course I hoped she
would be happy and all that but of course after this
long hiatus we could never be friends in the same
old way. Oh, it was an icy letter, just as politely
nasty as I could make it! I sent it off and afterwards
I felt just exactly the way I used to when I
was a small child and had been naughty and wanted
to make up. But I didn't. I tried to forget it. I was
very busy and had a lot of people visiting me, last
summer. So the thought of Janet didn't come into
my head very often and when it did I mentally
changed the subject. Of course I never heard from
her again.</p>

<p>"One day, after we came back to town I was
reading, not thinking of anything but the book&mdash;Janey
least of all. Nothing in that book could have
reminded me of her. I read it over afterwards to
see. I looked up all of a sudden, thinking of Janet&mdash;thinking
of her as if I had been with her an hour
before. I dropped the book and felt as if I had just
seen her, standing at the door in a familiar kimono,
and heard her addressing me for the first time by
that ridiculous nickname that she had just invented.
I had heard through some people from her town
that she was going to be married soon. My pride
simply vanished. I dashed up and wrote her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the good old friendly way, told her what a nice
lady she was and how often I thought of her, what
I had been doing, and all sorts of natural old things,
as if I had been writing to her regularly for years.
I sent that letter off wondering if she would answer.
Two days later I heard somehow that she
had typhoid fever, but I thought that if she got
my letter she would surely answer somehow,
though she had been ill for days then."</p>

<p>Evelyn turned and showed me a photograph of
herself and Janet laughing and entwined in an attitude
of exaggerated affection.</p>

<p>"The next thing I heard of Janey," she continued,
"was the news of her death and I shall
never know whether she received my letter."</p>

<h2><a name="CATHERINES_CAREER" id="CATHERINES_CAREER"><i>CATHERINE'S CAREER</i></a></h2>


<p>"Now, Jack, please don't be sentimental. You
know how I hate it. Besides you have interrupted
me just when I was convincing you that
education will solve the race problem, and that
is annoying." Poor Jack! Catherine little imagined
what courage that interruption had taken.
Nor did she realize how unheeding he had been
as she rolled forth her arguments. (She had just
been reading an article in <i>The North American
Review</i>.)</p>

<p>"But, you know, I have been wanting to speak
for..."</p>

<p>"I thought you knew better, too," Catherine
continued a little sorrowfully, "a person of my
ambitious aspirations" (Catherine lived for ambitious
aspirations), "isn't going to be happy settling
down into a general entertainer and housekeeper
for mankind, always sweet and pretty and dainty,
standing every evening on the little porch all
tumbling over with honeysuckle, dressed in white
with a red rose tucked in my belt (that's your ideal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
isn't it?) and a hand stretched forth in undulating
curves to welcome you. This way." Catherine
stood up, balanced herself and nearly fell
down. "No, I can't even do it. And then I'm
not 'sweet and lovely.' I hate 'sweet and lovely'
girls. Why, every girl who hasn't any looks,
or any brains, or anything else, is considered
'sweet and lovely.'"</p>

<p>"I never said you were 'sweet and lovely.'"</p>

<p>"Oh! then you consider me horrid and disagreeable,
do you? Well, that's flattering. No, I
can't marry you. Such a catastrophe has never
once entered my head." Catherine grew pensive.
"I can't imagine anything more frightful than
playing the piano, arranging flowers, and being
charming, to eternity." Jack had jumped up from
his seat by the piano and stalked over to the window
where he stood biting his lips and beating the
floor with one foot, gazing out into the black
night with an impatiently reflective air. When
Catherine finished, he spoke half to himself and
half to the night.</p>

<p>"Just what Charlie Dickenson warned me would
happen. 'See here, old chap,' he said, 'if you
don't want to be the laughing stock of the whole
club you'd better steer clear of Catherine Neville.
Those college girls are chock full of notions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
I suppose she does like you in a way, because
you listen to her theories. But it is a ticklish
business. Remember poor Harry Cockran, the
trouble he had!' ... I thought she liked me.
But I see now that one can't expect anything sensible
from them." Catherine did not appear to listen.
She was playing a series of changing chords on
the piano. But the chords grew louder and louder
and gradually passed into the minor key, until at
the last word she spun round on the stool.</p>

<p>"Sensible?" she exclaimed. "That depends
upon the point of view. I think we are extremely
sensible. For we can be reached only through
our minds, not through our emotions. Any girl
can fall in love. But few have the strength of
mind to see that they are needed for loftier careers.
We have ideals, aims, purposes."</p>

<p>"Exactly. You long to be strong-minded, to
take to platforms, stand up for poor oppressed
womankind, and generally make a lot of trouble.
Why all the men say that nothing would induce
them to marry college girls. They think it's ruination
of a nice, pretty, sensible girl to send her
to college, and let her head get filled with all sorts
of ideas. I tell you it ruins them with the men.
But I had rather hoped you were an exception, or
at least above the average."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"You men are too exasperating. You inherit
from your grandfathers poor, foolish, worn-out
ideas that stick in your stubborn, narrow-minded
little brains. No amount of eloquence on
my part could convince you of anything else. I
might talk myself blue in the face, and there you
would sit, placid and serene in the error of your
judgment. Nothing could change you, except, perhaps,
a change of grandfathers. I suppose you consider
it woman's place to&mdash;bask in your radiance.
Well, I sha'n't argue with you. What's the use? I
hate a quarrel. Why don't you go? Don't you see
that I have had enough of you? Don't you see that
I am annoyed with it all?" Catherine was walking
impatiently up and down the room, tearing the roses
at her belt&mdash;his roses&mdash;and flinging the petals on the
floor. "I hope I shall never see you again." Then,
in a lower tone, "(No, I can never love him. I am
thoroughly convinced of that.) What are you waiting
for? No, I shan't say good-bye. I shouldn't
feel it. I am thoroughly miserable. I thought you
were such a good friend of mine, too. I can't be
polite. I'm tired of being polite when I feel rude. I
am tired of hearing all this twaddle about marrying
college girls. I think you might have had more
tact." Catherine rushed from the room and upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack Livingston heard the door at the top of the
stairs shut, not quite gently.</p>

<p>Catherine Neville was a junior at Bryn Mawr.
Most people considered her proud because of a certain
haughty reserved exterior, but her intimate friends
who had pierced the reserve knew her to possess
a really genial nature, and on occasions to become
quite mellow and entertaining. But it was only
with a favoured few that she descended to jocosity.
She was conceited, too. There is no doubt about
it, but who that ever amounts to anything isn't? at
least just a little bit. Perhaps she was spoiled. But
if that was the case, it was scarcely her fault, because
she was an only child, and had always been pampered
and praised and led to consider herself a really
remarkable young person. As a small child her mother
had looked upon her as a budding genius, and had
cherished and retailed to forcedly enthusiastic
friends her various idiosyncracies&mdash;undoubted signs
of genius. But when she grew a little older, and
scorned dolls and "<i>The Five Little Peppers</i>," things
had gone too far. "A little genius is all very well,
but a great deal is so conspicuous," Mrs. Neville
used to say. (The Nevilles belonged to a very old
Philadelphia family.) The last straw in a long line
of disappointments came, however, when Catherine
announced her intention of going to college. "A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
daughter of the Nevilles in college! Preposterous!
It is all very well for a girl who has her own living to
make. But a Neville!" And Mrs. Neville and Mrs.
Neville's friends held up their hands in indignant,
old-fashioned horror. Catherine had also indelicate
aspirations toward a career. But she kept these to
herself until she was safely launched upon her freshman
year. Even then her plans were very misty.
She thought perhaps she would consent to being
considered a second Mrs. Browning, or possibly a
George Eliot. It was a dreadful blow to Mr. and
Mrs. Neville when Catherine passed all her examinations.
Up to that time they had kept themselves
happy with the thought that Catherine might fail.
Of course Catherine was very clever, but they had
always heard that it took a monstrosity to pass the
Bryn Mawr entrance examinations. Mr. and Mrs.
Neville were especially vexed because their plans had
all been upset, and they had formed such delightful
ones, too. She was to have a "coming out" tea in
November, followed by a series of dinners, culminating
in a ball early in January&mdash;with a possible wedding
at Easter. What more could a girl wish? But
Catherine was undoubtedly peculiar. She refused
to be trotted out at teas and put through her paces
at the Monday evening dancing class. She said that
dinners bored her, and balls were a frightful nuisance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
and she didn't want to be married off. And
so it was that Catherine never "came out," but
passed into that atmosphere of social depravity and
advanced ideas that old-fashioned conventionality
has associated with a woman's college.</p>

<p>Is it to be wondered at that Catherine had lost
her self-control just a little bit this evening? College
with her was a very tender subject. Nevertheless
as she stood upstairs with her head near the
crack of the slammed door waiting to hear the front
door latch, she felt desperately ashamed of herself.
But how could she be expected to give up the pet
dreams of her youth&mdash;all at once and for a man?
She didn't like him much, anyway, and she still
longed for her career. In fact she quite expected it
and such an emergency as falling in love had never
once entered her mind. Of course she had seen a
great deal of Jack, but he had never been anything
to her, at all. Yet he was quite nice, infinitely
nicer than the rest of the men. They bored her.
The conceited little idiots thought every girl they
saw in love with them, and that all they had to do
was to sit and be adored. But Jack somehow was
different. He had so much more to him. He was
so big and fine, so noble looking. He had such
good-looking shoulders. Somehow she liked to see
them around. She might have stood him for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
shoulders, at least, until the end of the Christmas
vacation. But it did make her furious to hear men
run down college girls and say that they didn't
want to marry them. Just as if the college girls
were pining for them! Men would be much
nicer if they didn't consider themselves charmers.
"Still it will be frightfully dull now for the
last few days at home," Catherine thought as she
fixed her hair. She was used to seeing him about.
And now no one would ask her to go skating.
She didn't want to go skating with any one
else. And they used to have such interesting talks
together too! Well, it was all over now. She
might as well go to sleep. So she snuggled up in the
down comfortable and said she would make her mind
a blank. But there was always a little something
there, edging her on to the forbidden subject with
most annoying insistence. Jack was always mixed
up in her thoughts, and she kept wondering if he
really cared for her. Of course it was nothing to
her. But it is nice to be liked, and somehow it
worried Catherine dreadfully to think that perhaps
he didn't care for her. "Oh, but he must care or
he never would have spoken as he did," Catherine
exclaimed out loud. And then, frightened at her
own voice, she muffled her head in the bedclothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p>Catherine's thoughts wandered off to her freshman
year and that afternoon early in spring when
she had received the telegram from her father&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Livingston will call at eight o'clock.</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">W. D. Neville.</span>"
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Catherine had read it slowly for the second time
and wondered who on earth "Mr. Livingston"
was and what she had done that deserved this punishment.
She finally decided that Mr. Livingston
was a friend of her father's, some nice old gentleman
who took an interest in the higher education
of women, and wanted to be taken around the college.
"Night's a bad time," she reflected, and
speculated happily on the chances of $10,000 toward
the library building. Nevertheless she did
not feel quite comfortable until she was safely at
dinner with the doors closed. One never knows
what elderly men interested in the higher education
of women may do. They are always so intensely
interested. He might come out in time for dinner,
just for the beneficial experience of seeing how this
strange product of the human race eats, and
whether or not, as has been said, it lives exclusively
on fish. "He is probably of a deeply enquiring
nature and will want statistics," Catherine mused.
"I must review mine. Let me see. There are
sixty-seven 'grads,' one hundred and nine freshmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and&mdash;&mdash;" But, alas! these were all she knew.
Well, she could at least explain the "Group System."
A complexity of that sort would be something
for the old gentleman to gloat over. She
knew it quite well now. She had just had some
lessons on it from the sophomore next door. And
then, of course, there was the seventeen per cent.
statistic. How stupid in her to forget that! She
had heard it often enough, at least twice a month
since she entered. "Yes, that will make a very
good beginning," and Catherine sprinkled her beef
so vigorously with salt that she was forced to send
for a second supply.</p>

<p>Dinner had just reached the salad stage, when the
maid whispered to Catherine, in mysterious tones,
that there was a gentleman in the hall who wished
to see her. "Mr. Livingston!" she gasped, and
rushed out. "How fortunate that dinner is almost
over! But perhaps the poor man is starving. Oh!
but I can't have him in. I'll be hard-hearted. I'll
hope that he had a chicken sandwich and a glass of
milk at Broad Street Station. But what a strange
man for father to send!" Catherine thought as she
cordially grasped the hand of a beery object in the
dark corner of the hall. "I beg yir pardin, miss,
but I'm Jim Maloney, and me wife as does yir
laundree is very poor, en has siven childrin en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
wants to be paid." The man held toward her a
soiled, rumpled half sheet of lined paper. "One
dollar and twenty-nine cents," Catherine read between
the blots, and remarked to herself that there
were only five children last week. But supposing
there had been twins, she ran singing upstairs and
munificently raised the amount to one dollar and
thirty cents. "The dollar and a quarter is easy, but
four cents is such a difficult amount!" she said, excusing
her extravagance, while taking her seat at
the dinner table again. "One always has to hunt
through all one's coat pockets, stamp boxes, and
various trays and receptacles on the bureau, and do
at least fifty cents' worth of nervous worry and
scurry, perhaps even then not finding the four
cents." Catherine was happy again, for she still
had forty minutes of liberty, ample time in which
mentally to run through a possible conversation
with an inquisitive elderly gentleman and arrange
all her material in paragraphs with a suitable introduction
and conclusion. She felt as if she were
going to make an address, and had a wild desire to
begin. "Esteemed elderly gentleman, it gives me
great pleasure to expound to you this evening
the&mdash;etc." But of course that would never do.</p>

<p>At exactly five minutes after eight Mr. Livingston's
card was handed to Catherine. "Elderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and investigating gentlemen are exasperatingly
prompt," she murmured. "He has evidently taken
the 7:15 train from the city and has killed time
about the campus or been lost for ten minutes,"
she thought, as she glided downstairs, settling the
bow of her ribbon collar primly in front. "Yes, Mr.
Livingston," she rehearsed, "the freshman class contains
one hundred and seven girls, average age, eighteen;
average height, five feet five inches; average
weight&mdash;&mdash; Oh, dear me! I've forgotten my average
weight, and that was to have led to such interesting
discussions of the comparative amount of nutriment
in the different preferred foods."</p>

<p>Just at this moment Catherine reached the door
of the reception-room, gave her belt a last little
twitch straight and walked in. From the least
brilliantly lighted corner of the room arose a tall,
broad-shouldered man of twenty-five. Poor fellow!
He had shrunk there from pursuing pairs of
eyes! "Dear me, it isn't the inquisitive, elderly
gentleman after all," Catherine pouted disappointedly
as she and Mr. Livingston took their seats
at the extreme ends of a long sofa. "Now, my
plans are all upset." Catherine wanted to say,
"Who are you, anyway? Why aren't you inquisitive
and elderly? That type is so interesting!"
But that didn't seem polite, and he looked harmless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
so she spoke of the weather, and the walk from the
station, the ride out in the train, and the people one
sees in Broad Street Station, and hoped that time
would unfold the mystery. Just then the top of a
head and two eyes rose perpendicularly above the
window-sill in front of them, remained stationary
for a few seconds, and then sank slowly, followed
by a suppressed giggle and the sound of fleeing
footsteps. They both saw the eyes, and both being
interested in proceedings outdoors, forgot for a
moment the absence of conversation.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Livingston," Catherine finally droned
forth absent-mindedly. "There are one hundred
and seven in the freshman class, average age, eighteen,
average height, five feet five inches, average
weight, two hundred and eighty pounds, and only
seventeen per cent. will marry! At least&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How extraordinary!" interrupted Mr. Livingston,
while Catherine awoke with a start and wondered
if a little fresh air would not be beneficial to
both of them. Another pair of eyes arose above
the window-sill. There was a second pause and
Mr. Livingston said that he thought it would be delightful
to look at the grounds. They waited a
moment just to satisfy the curiosity of a third pair
of eyes and then wandered out on to the campus.
It was deliciously balmy, but as it was nine o'clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
on a moonless night their horizon was limited.
Still by peering industriously they could distinguish
a few dark objects that Catherine explained
to be trees, and by means of her descriptive powers
(she never knew she had any until that night), Mr.
Livingston was enabled to enjoy the distant prospect
of Rosemont and the rolling hills beyond.
When they returned to the reception-room, Catherine
felt quite recovered from her little attack of
absent-mindedness and hoped that the air had been
equally beneficial to her uncommunicative visitor.
"I have been talking too much," she thought as she
watched the careful descent of eyes number four.
"Poor Mr. Livingston has not had a chance to enlighten
me on the subject of his personal history. I
must be silent." A fifth pair of eyes appeared at
the window, and the silence was unbroken for such
a long time that Catherine in desperation launched
forth upon Political Economy theories. (Political
Economy and History were her majors, and she always
turned to them in times of need.)</p>

<p>And so it continued all evening. Catherine was
still ignorant of her visitor's history, but she had
counted twenty-seven pairs of eyes. She wondered
if Mr. Livingston's and her count agreed.
She had counted hers on her fingers, but had a
dreadful feeling that she had made a mistake of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
hand somewhere and was five too many. Mr.
Livingston looked mathematical. She longed to
ask him how many he had seen. Finally the
witching hour of ten arrived. There was a scampering
of footsteps through the hall and a long tolling
of Taylor bell. A maid wandered uneasily up
and down before the reception-room door. Catherine
knew it was time to put the lights out, but
somehow said nothing, for she had noticed certain
symptoms of uneasiness in her visitor, and felt they
were about to culminate in the "good-bye" that
had been worrying him since half-past nine. They
did culminate, at twenty minutes after ten, when
he at length departed. Catherine wondered why
men stay two hours and a quarter when they come
for a half-hour call. Perhaps they think that they
don't appear to be enjoying themselves if they leave
before their two hours and a quarter is up. The
substance of the letter that Catherine had mailed to
her father that night briefly stated would read:
"Who on earth is Mr. Livingston? Please restrain
him from calling again."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gradually Catherine returned to the present. She
didn't see how Jack could care very much. Then
she bounced over on to the cold side of the bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and held her eyes tight shut. Still her thoughts
rambled on.</p>

<p>The next day Catherine looked pale and wan.
Her mother thought she had better stay in bed and
rest because there were only four days left of the
vacation and she mustn't go back to college all
worn out. But Catherine thought she needed air.
The house oppressed her, so she decided to go for
a walk in her most becoming clothes. Jack always
went to the office between nine and half-past.
Perhaps she might meet him. But what could she
do if she did meet him? Bow stiffly? That
would not be especially satisfactory, but what else
could she do? She couldn't appear sorry for what
she had said last night. And yet she would like to
have him find it out&mdash;indirectly. No, she wouldn't
go to walk. It wouldn't look well. She would
take her mother's advice after all, and go to bed.</p>

<p>Jack in the meantime felt like a culprit. He had
spoiled everything by his inane lack of judgment.
He ought to have known better. He should at
least have remembered the career. It was all up
with him now. But he felt sure she liked him. If
he had only made a few pretty speeches, complimented
her a little and broken the ice gently! He
feared he had been a little abrupt. But it wasn't
his fault if he couldn't talk. He meant a lot more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
than the other fellows who have it all at their
fingers' ends. But girls never can appreciate fine
men. Anything does, if it is only well-dressed.
And yet Catherine had really shown a great deal of
discretion. In fact she had openly preferred him to
the other men. Somehow she had always evinced
much pleasure in his conversation. Perhaps it
was because he listened to her theories and the
other men wouldn't. Oh, but it couldn't have been
that! Anyway, he had enjoyed hearing her talk.
He couldn't bear the chatter of most girls. Yes,
she was a fine girl, always well groomed and a
thoroughbred, the kind of girl with whom a man
liked to be seen walking down the street. Perhaps
she hadn't meant it all. He thought he ought
to call again, but he didn't exactly care to go where
he wasn't wanted. Still he decided to throw aside
his pride and call that evening at the Nevilles, just
as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>But all his hopes were shattered when the maid
informed him at the door that Miss Catherine could
not see any one that evening. "A polite way of
asking me not to call again," thought Livingston, as
he hurried off. He was really annoyed now and
vowed never to go near the place again. The maid
forgot to tell Catherine about the call.</p>

<p>John Livingston had recently been admitted as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
junior partner into the firm of W. D. Neville &amp; Co.
His rise had been rather phenomenal. Five years
ago, in the summer time, three weeks after receiving
his A. B., he started out bravely to work
his way up in the world from the very beginning,
and having entered the steel and iron works as an
ordinary labourer, he had come to be a foreman of
the shops. It was then that he attracted attention
by his remarkable industry and popularity among
the workmen, and thus came to Mr. Neville's notice.
Mr. Neville at once appreciated his clear business
head and knack of getting along well with men and
pushed him on, so that he passed from one position
of trust to another until he was finally admitted
into the firm as a junior partner.</p>

<p>Worldly people might have imagined that Mr.
Neville had designs when he sent Jack Livingston
out to call on his daughter at Bryn Mawr, and when
he encouraged his coming to the Neville house,
especially during the holidays. Frequently&mdash;two
or three times a week&mdash;Jack was asked to dine
until it became such an expected event that he
always stayed to dinner without being asked. But
any one who knew the family at all well would
laugh at the worldly idea, for Mr. Neville well knew
the fruitlessness of forming designs upon Catherine's
future. In fact no one realized so well as Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Neville that Catherine had no time for anything
except her career and that she didn't care for men.
All she wanted was peace and a name for herself.
Perhaps Mr. Neville was dubious about Catherine's
ability to become a Mrs. Browning or a George
Eliot. (He was an exceedingly practical man.)
"Of course Catherine is exceptionally clever," he
used to say. Nevertheless he felt or at least hoped
that her mind was well balanced, and doubted the
arrival of those expected bursts of genius on which
she built so many castles in the air.</p>

<p>During the four days that remained of the Christmas
vacation, Jack persistently refused to come to
the Neville house to dinner. He was always busy
packing or something. This was a bad sign. To
be sure Jack was going to Chicago in a week, but
every one knows that a man never starts his packing
until eleven o'clock on the night before his
departure. He goes into the first store he sees on
the day of his arrival, buys all the things he has
forgotten and never again mentions the subject.
Therefore Mr. Neville was a little worried, but he
kept quiet and reassured himself by thinking that
Jack's shunning the Neville house was merely a
phase in an ultimately satisfactory love affair. He
did not tell Mrs. Neville his plans or his woes. He
knew her too well, and never confided delicate little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
matters like this to her kind-hearted, bungling
management. Poor Mrs. Neville! with the best
intentions in the world, she always ruined everything.</p>

<p>Catherine, in the meantime, was not at all like
herself. She moped, scolded, and was generally
irritable and unpleasant. Her mother could not
imagine what had happened. Catherine was so
changed; she sat around and looked mysterious
and gloomy and absolutely refused to go anywhere.
To be sure she had never been riotous in
her pursuit of pleasure, but still she had always gone
about a good deal, and had really seemed to enjoy
things in a characteristically unbending way. But
now all was different. Mrs. Neville was in despair
and promptly jumped to the conclusion that Catherine
was suffering from nervous prostration
brought on by overwork at college. Mrs. Neville
had always said she would have it, and really there
was nothing else that could make her act so
queerly. "Catherine is so energetic," she told her
friends when they came to console. (They all felt
sorry for Bessie Neville. Her daughter was such a
disappointment. Their own daughters all did
embroidery in the morning, and went to teas with
their mothers in the afternoon.) "Catherine must
be in everything," she said, "and never is satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
to do things half-way. No wonder the child has
broken down. I shan't let her go back. No," and
she set her mouth firmly, "health after all is the
first thing to consider." Nevertheless their old
family physician persuaded her that there was nothing
like work for nervous prostration, so Catherine,
in spite of the firmly set mouth, appeared at college
just in time to register. However, she was loaded
down with pills, tonics and strict injunctions to
write all developments of symptoms.</p>

<p>Catherine was glad to get back. She had never
spent such a disappointing holiday. Yet though
she felt horribly mournful and wandered about
with the gloomy, tragic expression of a person
with a past, she hoped she could fight it down,
work and forget everything. She would either
have to do that or be wretched always. For she
knew Jack would never come near her again. Of
course she did not want to see him. She was
simply annoyed at his neglect. Why, from what
her mother said, it seemed as if Jack had absolutely
planned his "good-bye" call at the house to miss
her, and had then apologized as if he hadn't known.
Well, everything had happened for the best. She
was really becoming too much interested in Jack
Livingston. But now she could forget it all, and
work and make something out of her life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>With mid-years, a twenty-four page essay, Latin
and English private reading and all sorts of unfinished
odds and ends of labour, one's previous
misfortunes vanish behind the rapidly accumulating
wretchedness of the four weeks after the Christmas
vacation. This is the period at Bryn Mawr when one
wonders what on earth became of the first part of
the semester, and one firmly resolves this time at
least to keep good resolutions and never again be
guilty of such improvident idleness; this is the
period when one wakes up on bright, crisp
mornings to the wretched realization that an examination
is due next day in a subject of which one
knows or feels that one knows absolutely nothing;
this is the period when, after struggles too painful
to describe, one turns up on the fatal morning pallid
but resolute, armed with a pen and scraggy blotter
and with Tennyson's immortal words "theirs but
to do or die," ringing in one's ears; this is the
period when after seizing the examination questions
one thrills or congeals in proportion to the number
of intimate friends, bowing acquaintances or total
strangers there enrolled. Nevertheless one survives
even the worst, though in a more or less battered
condition, and after two weeks punctuated with
these periods of violent searching thought and
despairing drains on the imagination, one at length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
emerges into the happy serenity of the middle of
February.</p>

<p>So Catherine having passed through the wear and
tear of mid-years had almost recovered from her
attack of nervous prostration. One day she was
sitting on the floor in her study chatting happily
with some friends. They had finished their chocolate,
and the empty cups had been pushed just
wherever it was most convenient to put them and
most inconvenient for them to be, when Emily
Ashurst broke into the general talk with, "By the
way, Catherine, I had a letter this morning from a
friend of mine in Chicago, which I think will probably
interest you. You know Jack Livingston,
don't you?" Catherine nodded, and grew a little
pinker than usual. "You know, he went to
Chicago early in January on business connected
with some steel works out there. Well, he was
quite popular and taken around a lot and now they
say he is engaged to a girl there, a Miss Lyla&mdash;oh,
bother!&mdash;well she is exceedingly pretty&mdash;just the
sweet, piquant marrying kind that a man adores.
They say it was a most romantic affair. Sort of
love at first sight. He is perfectly devoted and
her friends are delighted with the match. Mr.
Livingston has taken them all by storm." But
Catherine was not particularly enthusiastic, so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
conversation drifted on to basket ball possibilities
for the spring. Catherine, however, was not in the
least interested in basket ball now, though she was
considered one of the most promising forwards.
She felt awfully tired, and was secretly relieved
when there was a general uprising from the floor
and all her guests departed in a flock. Then she
was left to her own unhappy thoughts and the
concentration of chocolate cups in the one spot that
always appealed most strongly to the naturally
sympathetic disposition of the maid when she came
to straighten up in the morning.</p>

<p>"Jack didn't care at all then," she said, and
swallowed a pill. She felt that her nervous prostration
was returning, and the pills were the least
objectionable of the medicines. "If he had cared
he never would have become engaged within six
weeks," she sighed. But she didn't see why <i>she</i>
should care. He was nothing to <i>her</i>. But her
father would be so disappointed. He was interested
in Jack and didn't approve of men under
thirty getting married. And then it really was
most inconsiderate after the way he had spoken to
her. "I suppose I shall have to write and congratulate
him. That's a bore! I never know what
to say to engaged people, anyway. Yet I should
like to write to him, just to show that there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
ill-feeling, and that I am really quite pleased to hear
that he has at last persuaded some one to take him.
I'll make the letter rather stiff and formal. Yes, I
must write. But suppose he isn't engaged after all,
wouldn't it seem as if I were forcing myself into a
correspondence with him? No, it wouldn't appear
well to write, at least, until the engagement was
confirmed." Catherine glowed with newly awakened
hope. She was glad she had decided not to
write, for she dreaded to involve herself in any
more awkward predicaments. They were so wearing
on the mind.</p>

<p>In the meantime the day was drawing near when
Catherine's story must be handed in for <i>The
Lantern</i>. But nothing seemed to have developed.
On several occasions she had sat down, well provided
with white receptive sheets of paper, ready to
pour out her soul. She had gnawed her pencil and
looked bored for half an hour, and then had jumped
up and rushed outdoors for some fresh air. Each
time she had been expectant and eager to jot down
the ideas she thought would crowd into her mind.
(One never knows what may happen when one is
actually provided with pencil and paper.) But
somehow nothing had come, and she really felt
now that she was altogether too wretched for ideas.</p>

<p>In desperation she decided to prune and nourish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
a little love story based on her own affair. It would
amuse her, and no one need know that it was not
purely imaginary. You can make things so much
more real and vivid when drawing from your own
feelings and experiences. Of course she would
exaggerate a great deal and make it more interesting.
And in her story the heroine could write a
letter of congratulation to the hero in Chicago, a
letter meant to be cold and formal, but into which
had crept, in spite of herself, a plaintive, sorrowful
strain. (Catherine thought that part quite romantic.)
The hero on receipt of the letter could be
very much mystified. He was not engaged and
had no intentions of becoming engaged, though
there had been a rumour. But reading between
the lines he should see the heroine's love for him&mdash;this
part of course could be entirely imaginary&mdash;pack
his dress-suit case and take the first train for
Philadelphia. He should then rush out to Bryn
Mawr and throw himself at the heroine's feet, and
all would end happily. (Catherine sighed deeply.)</p>

<p>The end, however, presented difficulties, for
where should she have the hero throw himself at
the heroine's feet? The reception-room was such
a public place. (She thought of the pursuing pairs
of eyes that hunt one out of the darkest corners of
reception-rooms.) Finally she fixed upon the Vaux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
woods. It was such a picturesque spot, she knew
Jack would have liked it. "Yes," she said to herself,
"he must restrain his feelings until the heroine
has bowed him into a portion of the Vaux woods,
where they will be uninterrupted by giggles."</p>

<p>The story was handed in, and toward the end of
May made its appearance in the pages of <i>The
Lantern</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the meantime Jack Livingston, on the shores
of Lake Michigan, was becoming desperately tired
of going to dinners and looking out for the Chicago
interests of the firm. He wanted to see some one
who really cared for him, some one who would ask
him out to dinner, even if he did not represent
W. D. Neville &amp; Co., of Philadelphia. He wanted to
be asked out, fondled and admired a little for himself.
Perhaps he was homesick. At any rate he
decided to shirk social duties and spend an evening
quietly with the Hammersleys. There was such
an air of homelikeness and happiness about their
evenings. Charlie Hammersley had been an upper
classman of his at college, who had married a
Bryn Mawr girl a few months before. And now
they had a cozy little box just within the margin of
respectability of the North End. They were still at
dinner when Jack arrived. So he threw himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
into an armchair by the library table and reached
out for a magazine. The first he threw aside; he
was tired of actresses' pictures, and hated novelettes.
But something prompted him to investigate
the next, though it was unfamiliar. "<i>The Lantern</i>,
Bryn Mawr," he gasped in pleasant surprise, while
he ran his eye eagerly down the table of contents
for a certain well-known name. Before long he
was buried in Catherine's little love story.</p>

<p>When the Hammersleys came in from the dining-room,
they found Jack standing with one arm
against the mantelpiece and a far-away expression
in his eyes. He started when he saw them with
an, "Oh! ... awfully glad to find you in ...
You see I've just dropped in to say good-bye
before starting for Philadelphia, to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"Philadelphia?" Mrs. Hammersley asked in surprise.
"You're an old fraud. I won't believe a
word of it. You know you said you never wanted
to see the place again. Besides you sent word by
the maid that we mustn't hurry because you had
come to spend one of those old-fashioned eight-to-eleven
evenings with us. Shall it be whist or hearts
to-night? Lyla, you'll make a fourth? ...
Let's have hearts to-night. I don't feel strong
enough for whist."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, really, I can't. You know, I should like it
above all things. But I have my trunk to pack and
arrangements to make. I'm going rather suddenly.
You see I've just decided." Jack wished he was
not clutching <i>The Lantern</i> so tightly in his left
hand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At Bryn Mawr finals were over and the
"'Varsity" had been picked, so that all excitement
was now centred in the alumnæ game. After years
of success, the undergraduates had got into the way
of looking upon this game as a walk-over. (It is
hardly the fault of the alumnæ if one or more years
of leisure do not add to their agility!) But now
that the alumnæ had the last year's seniors, the
champions of the college, to choose from, the
under-graduates secretly trembled.</p>

<p>For this reason there was unusual excitement
over the game, and the greater part of the college
was sitting cross-legged around the basket ball
field cheering excitedly, while a few rushed importantly
up and down, flourishing lemons and towels.
It was the beginning of the second half, and neither
side had scored. The undergraduates felt weak,
while the small group of alumnæ at one corner of
the field were clutching each other excitedly.
Every one was too much interested in the game to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
notice a tall, broad shouldered man who had just
joined the outskirts of the crowd and was anxiously
following with his eyes every movement of the
'Varsity's most graceful forward. But two minutes
of play remained, the ball seemed rooted in the
alumnæ territory and the undergraduates were pale
and heaving with suppressed woe, when the alumnæ
lost the ball and it passed quickly down the field
into the hands of the 'Varsity's tall, graceful forward.
For one silent second she aimed, and then
amid shrieks of joy the ball spun cleanly into the
basket, while, with a little gasp of pain, Catherine
Neville, the 'Varsity's pet forward, sank fainting
upon the ground. Her ankle was badly sprained.
When Catherine recovered consciousness, the tall,
broad shouldered man from the outskirts of the
crowd, was leaning over her, a most distressed expression
in his eyes. In spite of her pain, Catherine
gave a little gasp of pleasure. "He does care for
me after all," she murmured under her breath. Her
eyes grew dim and she felt herself going off again
into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Another summer had passed by and the juniors
were now seniors, but one of the most popular
members of the class was missing. Catherine
Neville was to be married in November. As she
said to one of her friends, she was satisfied, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Jack was satisfied, and they didn't see why they
should wait. Anyway, Jack was awfully lonely
out in Chicago, all by himself, and it was her duty
to go out and cheer him up.</p>

<p>Catherine had decided upon her career. She had
found her purpose in life.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_APOSTASY_OF_ANITA" id="THE_APOSTASY_OF_ANITA"><i>THE APOSTASY OF ANITA
FISKE</i></a></h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Anita Fiske was no longer wholly absorbed in the
student life. This was all she herself understood.
Any one else would have seen only generosity on
the part of the Fates in the pleasant passing for her
of busy days; that is, were it not customary to refer
to the interposition of the Fates chiefly on
occasions of dire calamity or of some especially
flagrant instance of human incompetence or indolence&mdash;and
indolent or incompetent Anita was not.</p>

<p>The right to be described by very different adjectives
would have been granted to her by the most
captious critic in her college world. There is a lack
of finality in the judgment of this world; even
members of it could be brought to agree, if you
specifically raised the point, to the truism about the
test through the larger issues in the world outside.
They could indeed justly claim that their estimate
of capability was a very decently fair one; also
their estimate of capacity for enjoyment; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
unfortunately for the final value of their opinion,
sometimes later on the fortunate possessor of these
excellent capabilities and capacities may insist on
turning to pursuits calling for another set of capabilities
which she does not possess; on the other
hand, since she is obviously very young, her capacity
for enjoyment may remain as great and yet
insist on a change of diet and she remain hungry
while trying to satisfy herself with once fancied
dainties. Such a double falling away as this from
the true faith may even occur before the close of
her college days. But&mdash;there are some perversions
merely temporary of the true and correct inclinations.</p>

<p>This fact might comfort the critic in certain cases,
perhaps in that of Anita Fiske, should any of the
above considerations be held to apply to her. Her
world would certainly have dismissed summarily
such foolish speculations. For where, it would
say, could you find one more obviously and
conspicuously fitted to the grave charm and still,
harmonious activity of the student life?</p>

<p>Anita was the daughter of a clergyman who, after
years of conscientious if not over-successful care for
the spiritual welfare of a country town, was accused
of ultra-liberal tendencies and to avoid vain
discussion had resigned his pulpit and moved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
New York. The family migration had occurred but
a few months before Anita entered college; she was
a New Yorker in name only,&mdash;she avowed this
somewhat sadly, for a passionate affection for this
city of her adoption was one of the anomalies in
her character. So at least her friend Isabel Oakley
felt, for Isabel was a born New Yorker, a younger
member of the most light-hearted of families.
The Student and the Gayety Girl their companions
nicknamed the two friends, calling them after
characters in a play given two years earlier.</p>

<p>One grey February afternoon Isabel roused Anita
who sat looking out with wide eyes on the still
winter country.</p>

<p>"Come, you lazy object, you dream too long. Is
it of the life history of a root?&mdash;a Gothic root, I fear&mdash;with
due respect to your preference for mould
over mere modern earth. I insist upon&mdash;well, not
snow-balling," as she looked from her goodly height
down on the slender figure, "but at least on a race
when we have left the proprieties of the village behind."</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;but I scorn your insinuation in regard
to roots. Look at this."</p>

<p>She drew her friend down beside her and pushed
the yellow curtains more wide apart. The pale
light of a winter afternoon fell across long stretches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of snow and on burdened trees, bending down
heavy branches as though to rest their weight on
the firm earth; and sometimes a little mass of
feathery snow slipped noiselessly from its uncertain
bed and roughened where it fell the smoothness of
the white ground.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the two were going down the
walk and out through the old entrance between low
walls, now mere shapeless mounds in their covering
of tangled, snow-laden vines. Anita seemed even
more slender, though perhaps a trifle taller, than one
would have imagined seeing her crouched on the
window-seat. She had quick mouselike movements
and walked with sudden little starts as if she feared
to lag behind, and from her grey eyes all dreaminess
was gone. The other girl moved smoothly
and easily with the swinging gait of a strong young
animal and held her head high to the cold wind that
came over the open valley from the hills in the
west. Strands of bright hair blew over her forehead
and were tossed back as they threatened to
blind her quick brown eyes.</p>

<p>On the bridge over the railroad the wind cut
sharply. It poured along the black road below, between
high banks the whiteness of which was beginning
to grow dim in the unequal contest with
smoke and cinders. A woolly St. Bernard leaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
from a neighbouring garden to greet Isabel as the two
hesitated for a moment; when they started again
he fell in behind and trudged patiently on, with
only an occasional gambol which resulted in much
floundering, the snow being deep and his paws at
their clumsiest age.</p>

<p>Beyond the last houses of Rosemont village the
girls bent to a long, slow hill and, in spite of
quickened breath, refreshed themselves after the
long silences of the morning and early afternoon, and
the ordered speech of the classroom, by wandering
remarks, quick question and answer and an admiration
for the fretwork of trees against the sky more
freely expressed but less interjectional than is perhaps
the custom among other more frankly emotional
girls.</p>

<p>Their talk instinctively drifted back to the work
they cared for, though with avoidance of detail of
necessary drudgery or the friction in routine.
Truly original work only Anita had; but Isabel's interest
in original work was as deep as her own and
perhaps more free from the jar of conflicting desires.
This interest of hers would have been another
cause of perplexity to a self-appointed critic
of the two. Isabel was a society girl by birth and
tradition, and at college, through the impetus of all
her previous associations and also through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
adaptability which gained her immediate wide acquaintance,
she was confirmed in her destiny&mdash;popularity.
But, though the instinct for much intercourse
with one's kind and the superabundance
of animal spirits may close to their possessors the
gates within which the still scholar lives, yet even
such may truly care for those quiet places and look
almost with reverence on the things which there
stand first. In this fashion Isabel regarded the work
in which Anita was already noteworthy&mdash;in their
small world&mdash;and in which it was possible that she
might stand above the rank and file even in the
world of research outside, if the promise of these
first years should be fulfilled.</p>

<p>The talk turned to an Icelandic saga on which
Anita was working.</p>

<p>"Have you tried doing it in verse as that bit was
done in an English magazine last winter?" Isabel
asked, "or did it ring better in prose&mdash;but I am
afraid of the excellences of prose. Of course the
original I can only respect from afar,&mdash;but that German
professor's version&mdash;what was his name?&mdash;had,
I know, sacrificed the real spirit to a monumental
accuracy. Now please don't tell me you too
prefer his version, as you do the Revised, for that
same sordid reason."</p>

<p>"Most excellent Churchwoman! you object to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
change in the Authorized nearly as much as you
would to a change in the Prayer Book. But really
that piece that came out lately&mdash;of the saga, not the
Prayer Book,&mdash;was quite inaccurate," Anita musingly
added. "I am puzzled. I should care immensely
about doing the whole thing as you have
wanted me to. Bits go well. I confess I have done
several when the spirit moved too hard. I could go
on now I know." She raised her voice to be heard
in a sudden gust. "It was written, or sung rather,
to such a tune,&mdash;but up in the Seminar room the
passion for accuracy falls on me and a sense of
pride comes when I detect the accurate Professor
Wirthau in an error. I quite despise that piece in
English you spoke of. But now, come, I am in the
other mood. Let us go into partnership. You have
a turn for verse. I supply dry fact and you transform
it into poetry. Let a few of your friends
work for you and drop from some one committee&mdash;or
will this have to wait till next year?"</p>

<p>"Next year!" Isabel smiled at her friend. "You
are an institution here, Nita, no one would dream
of breaking your work off, but mine, such as it is,
comes this year to its natural end in an A. B. and
next year I shall be disporting myself among&mdash;well,
not Norse sea kings. My little sister is to come out
with me, you know, and as mamma is not strong I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
believe my superior age and learning are to serve
all but the formal needs of a chaperon."</p>

<p>"You a chaperon!" And Anita looked with
amusement at her friend.</p>

<p>"I assure you I should make an excellent one.
You mistake my character. It is almost portentously
tempered with gravity. Will you race me
from the church," she looked up at the deserted
and lonely Church of the Good Shepherd they were
then passing, "to the other, the cathedral?"&mdash;to St.
Thomas of Villa Nova, she meant.</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Clumsy-paws," Anita stopped panting,
"he is far behind."</p>

<p>After the tired dog had caught up with them,
looking reproachfully, they left behind the bleak
church which lifts its golden crosses with uncompromising
directness to the winter sky.</p>

<p>Through the fantastic snow twilight an hour
later, they climbed the winding hill road to the college.
Yellow lights shone steadily in ordered array&mdash;a
few dark figures passed by somewhere&mdash;then a
bell rang out suddenly and they hurried in. Yet
before turning to the serious duty of preparing for
dinner Anita let herself again be caught by her
more alert friend idling at the window.</p>

<p>"Another problem, is it? in addition or subtraction?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>"Subtraction," she turned from the cool stars
and rushing wind to the staid greeting of books and
manuscript, "but what I am subtracting is, perhaps,
no such loss after all&mdash;an unknown quantity,
you see."</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Anita had just received her father's answer to her
letter. Letters are notoriously liable to different interpretations
according as one confines oneself to
the desires and emotions expressed therein or to
those not expressed therein,&mdash;not to the uninitiated,
that is. Parents are not likely to be the initiated:
they have dealt too long in obvious literalness with
their children. So, when Anita in her letter laid
undue stress on her father's need of her and several
other needs classed as domestic, he saw only an
overdevelopment of the female conscientiousness in
matters household&mdash;and a spirit of sacrifice which
he duly admired. "Quite heroic, for her heart is set
upon staying on at college," the old gentleman had
remarked half aloud as he smoothed out her letter.</p>

<p>She read his answer as she sat before a cheerful
little fire, a quaint figure in a red and blue flowered
kimono. It was the interval between dinner and
the time to dress for a college reception. Gay little
noises came from the corridors as, by bright coloured
screens, soft pillows and stiff potted plants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
these were changing from mere means of communication
into places of refuge for those who preferred
to satisfy their social needs with a lesser
degree of illumination and crowding than the large
dining-hall, now reception-room, afforded.</p>

<p>Anita fingered her letter. She found it conclusive.
She also found herself uncertain as to just the
sentiments with which to regard it. His need of her
was quite ignored. That annoyed her; but obviously
in this she misunderstood him as completely
as he had misunderstood her. The letter spoke
of the vocation of the scholar and the sacrifice to it
of the lesser things. To this she agreed, or thought
she did, but had any one seen the grey eyes as they
looked fixedly into the fire, he would have seen in
these eyes a hunger which was not perhaps wholly
for scholarship. Anita had, at the time with full
conviction of sincerity, suggested a plan for going
on with her work in New York. There were libraries
there for the books needed&mdash;if one travelled
a good many miles. Her father, most wisely
and clearly, as she recognized somewhat wearily,
spoke of the difficulty of concentrating one's mind
on serious work among the distractions of a great
city. He himself had once dreamed of a scholar's
retirement.</p>

<p>She watched a blue flame curl over the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
an unburned coal and die down again. She well
understood this desire and had even felt it herself.
A few years before in Oxford, where she had
stayed a month during her one trip abroad, she had
longed for just such a life. She remembered how,
on one of those summer afternoons in the long
vacation, she had sat on the coping of a deserted
quad and looked across the tall sunlit grass to a
flowering white rosebush which clung and climbed
over the grey stone tracery, and then had turned
back to the worn inscriptions on the wall behind
her in memory of those who had worked there
many years before. For her the oak stairways up
from the cloisters led to anchorites' cells where men
worked through endless, still, summer days. She
was very young then and only in Oxford during the
long vacation. On her return she first saw Bryn
Mawr and then she said, with entire conviction,
that to be there would be very well. The long low
buildings half covered with creepers suggested, as
she saw these also deserted and on a summer day,
her dream of life at Oxford. Disillusionment, since
then, of course there had been. She had objected,
more than a healthy girl with steady nerves should
object, to the sounds of girlish talk and laughter, to
the many mechanical details of college life, and only
found the dream again when night had long come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
down in quietness and she saw the outline of halls
and campus trees soft and still in the moonlight, all
signs of newness gone and only a few lights here
and there to suggest the silent student. Of late she
had shrunk less from the rush and gayety of noise,
her objection lying now more against a certain
crudity in enjoyment which seems unavoidable at
some stages&mdash;in either sex.</p>

<p>And now as she sat in the bright kimono and
watched the little flame curl and die and half heard
the sound of gayety outside her door, Oxford was
no longer her dream city. The bored dweller in
towns who echoes the praise of rural life and poses
a martyr to the weariness endured in the city, may
smile at her for a foolish maiden, yet true it was
that now she longed for nothing more vague and
unknown, nothing more romantic and delightful
than simply New York. She longed not merely to
see it as now occasionally for a few brief days but
to live there, to breathe its heavy air, whether that
be tainted or pure, to hear the clamour of its streets.
To watch it there, would give for her an added
charm to the coming spring, to see it as it touches
the city square making this fresh and green in a frame
of busy walls with patterned beds of daisies and
pansies or early blooming crocuses and a springing
fountain in the midst. Here every one knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
her. She wished the wish most familiar, but for
that as urgent, to go day after day down in the
streets, one in the changing mass of passers-by, and
watch strange faces till the sense of personality was
swept away and forgotten. She wished to feel
again at night the fascination of a city then most
spectacular yet most itself, as one watches it perhaps
from a train and, along side streets, one sees
in sudden long flashes the streaming white lights.
What these lights were, lights of restaurant or
theatre or lights of music hall&mdash;where she might go
or where she might not,&mdash;she cared little now, she
wanted the picture and the sound. In time she
would want more, the dinner, the play,&mdash;this, however,
was all she now saw in the fire; but of this
she wanted her fill.</p>

<p>A voice, she knew it for Isabel's, spoke just outside
the door. She would never tell her all these
idle wishes, for Isabel had, or at least would soon
have, herself the reality of all of them and seemed
to hold it lightly. She, Anita, had once spoken
with a bit of impatience of some excellent phase
of college life and Isabel's eyes had grown troubled
as though the light words were almost a sacrilege.
How very much mistaken their little world was in
its opinion of the two! Anita's lips curled up in
a little satirical smile and Isabel entered the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not ready, Nita? A kimono, however charming,
is unfortunately not the recognized costume for
social occasions in this benighted land,&mdash;except for
our fellow-students of Japanese persuasion, so haste
you into frills and furbelows."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a party like any other,&mdash;bright lights,
gay dresses, a little music and a Distinguished Person,&mdash;only
a little more movement, groups of girls
drifting about together and watching rather than
making a part of it; a party taken, perhaps, not
very seriously; one, also, which broke itself up into
many little ones, these, in some cases, subdued
groups of victims gathered in for the amusement of
another person's unfortunate importation,&mdash;in other
cases, guests discreetly chosen from those not utter
strangers to each other; and one heard, here the
accents of a southern town, there the soft "thee"
of those who, small in number, have yet made
their own a city's nickname; a party on the whole
not homogeneous, restless and shifting, with a disproportion
even greater than usual between the
lightness of pale fabrics and the sombreness of
men's dress, a disproportion tending, even, it might
seem, to social joy&mdash;to judge by the greater gayety
in purely feminine groups.</p>

<p>On a stiff settee under the broad stairway Anita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
was established in the midst of a group of Isabel's
friends. It was one of the wisely chosen little
parties. All included in it belonged, in effect, to
one set in the city that counts numberless sets
courting recognition and as many more courting the
opposite. There was among those around Anita a
lady with presence, also a man who had, curiously,
refused to be a slave to his bank account and, at
forty-five, was causing many misgivings to his
friends&mdash;and much solid content to himself&mdash;through
this emancipation. The lady with presence
was not his wife, else the emancipation would still
have been unaccomplished. There were several
strong clear-eyed young men who were still revelling
in the untroubled joy of the first years of an
independent income; and they took life too seriously
to enter quickly into the serfdom which follows
after. Now they were preoccupied with buying
much pleasant experience in this country and
others. A few of them might, in addition to
pleasant living, do something worth while, one had
already done it, all were rather worth knowing.</p>

<p>Anita's face was a little flushed and she was
talking more than usual, though the air of habitual
stillness yet clung to her and her hands lay quiet on
her lap, half covered by the soft deep ruffles of her
blue gown. That she was a student of excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
promise was not known to those about her and
Isabel, from long experience, avoided, when within
earshot of her, the smallest reference to even the
least of her friend's attainments. They did see
only a very pretty girl who was talking gayly of
all sorts of things in New York with a delight
which was charmingly out of place, it seemed to
them, among these surroundings; for they could
not forget behind the mask of party dress the fact,
almost a menacing one to them, of its being a
woman's college. As they were New Yorkers by
inheritance and much more by education Anita was
unconsciously giving them subtle flattery, especially
as what she asked about and evidently cared for
was not merely the teas and dances uptown but the
work and play down among the tall buildings.
Isabel sat smiling at Anita's beauty&mdash;she gave the
word unreservedly that evening&mdash;and wondering at
her animation among these people who she had
feared would bore her friend sadly.</p>

<p>An allusion, a name, suggested a plan for the
following winter and they turned to Isabel.</p>

<p>"You are to be with us then?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, "I leave here in a few
months." The note of regret was almost evident.</p>

<p>"And Miss Fiske?"</p>

<p>"Ah! she is fortunate," Isabel answered quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
for her. "She has other things to fill her days.
No, I refrain from untimely allusions but we all
envy her life next year and the year after&mdash;for it is
all planned, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Anita replied after a little pause, "I shall
only be a few days in New York. I am to be very
busy."</p>

<p>The flush died off her face and, as she herself
was silent, the talk drifted away from her: when
Isabel looked at her next she saw again the quiet
face as she knew and liked it best with a gravity
which well avoided seriousness,&mdash;the eyes a little
larger and darker than usual under the bright
lights.</p>

<h2><a name="A_DIPLOMATIC_CRUSADE" id="A_DIPLOMATIC_CRUSADE"><i>A DIPLOMATIC CRUSADE</i></a></h2>


<p>Sunday after Mid-Years. A grey biting February
afternoon, with a promise of snow in the eager air,
was darkening over the deserted campus. The examinations,
which had finally dragged their slow
length to an end on Friday, seemed to have left a
peculiar haze in the mental atmosphere; for throughout
the college, whence all who could possibly do
so had departed for a brief rest, there was a subdued
and slightly melancholy air, as though no one
had yet realized that another four months must
elapse before the agony of having her knowledge investigated
would again rack mind and body.</p>

<p>Eleanor Mertoun, deep in the comfort of her cushioned
window-seat, alternately mused on the contrast
between her busy Thursday self and her lazy
Sunday self, and wished for the return of her roommate,
who was spending the Saturday and Sunday
in Philadelphia. It was certainly the time and
place in which to enjoy the retrospect of work done.
The red glow of a quiet little coal fire in the grate
mingled pleasantly with the fading cold light from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
without, and lit up warmly the dark green walls of
the study, and its polished floor. An antique oval
mirror in a dull old gilt frame dimly gave back the
double of a graceful sword fern which spread its
long fronds over the end of a well-filled bookcase
below. Eleanor, being in a contemplative mood,
stared hard at the fern and reflected that <i>it</i> toiled not
and was very beautiful. Before she could go on to
the philosophic consequences of her meditation, the
door was swung open vigorously, and in came a
tall figure in hat and ulster.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Marjorie Daw herself," exclaimed
Eleanor, springing up to greet the longed-for roommate.
"I thought you weren't coming back till
to-morrow? You're just in time to save me from
acute melancholia, but I can't believe you had any
premonition of that!"</p>

<p>"I'm <i>gefrohren</i>&mdash;give me a cup of hot tea, for
the love of&mdash;Me, and then I'll tell you," answered
Marjorie Conyngham, as she threw off hat and coat,
sat down on the rug by the hearth, and held out
both hands towards the fire.</p>

<p>Eleanor dashed out to fill the kettle, and soon had
a steaming cup and a "jammed" cracker ready for
Marjorie. Then she put a "Busy" sign on the outside
of the door to guard against too attentive
friends on borrowing bent, sat down beside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
newcomer, clasped her hands around her knees, and
commanded, "Go on."</p>

<p>"I had an unusual and severe attack of piety that
prevented me from cutting Pol. Econ. in the morning.
It was brought on, I think, by the idea of
having to copy six pages of lecture notes on the
social state of the indigent Indians."</p>

<p>Eleanor interrupted her. "Oh, I don't in the
least care what brought you, now that you're here.
I meant, I want to know all about the Atkinsons,
what you did and said,&mdash;and how many times you
upset your glass at table."</p>

<p>Marjorie passed over this insulting thrust, and irrelevantly
remarked: "Isn't it a pleasant thought that
exam. time is over, and so Betty Hall no longer goes
down the corridor warbling 'Earth is my resting
place, Heaven is my home,' or 'I'm a pilgrim and I'm
a stranger, I can tarry, I can tarry but a night'?"</p>

<p>Eleanor laughed at the remembrance. "It is,
surely. Poor old Betty! Doesn't she suffer more
from the fear of being flunked out than any upper-classman
you ever saw?&mdash;and she makes elaborate
preparations for going home at every exam. time.
But come back from this digression and stick to the
manuscript. Marge, conversationally you're a
tramp!"</p>

<p>"About the Atkinsons? They're very well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
thank you.&mdash;Oh, don't break my head with the
tongs and I will be good! I have a lovely tale to
tell you, really, Eleanor. I met a man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" interjected Eleanor.</p>

<p>"Who's digressing now?" demanded Marjorie.</p>

<p>A meek small voice from the gathering darkness
said "Little Ellie," and then Marjorie went on; "a
man whom you know quite well in the general if
not in the particular&mdash;a handsome, well-groomed,
middle-aged man with iron grey hair, serenest confidence
in his own judgment and estimate of things,
and&mdash;here you may perceive the rub, Lee&mdash;unconquerable
prejudice against the essentially modern
woman&mdash;in the abstract."</p>

<p>"Ah!" breathed Eleanor, scenting the battle
from afar.</p>

<p>"In the concrete, I confess, she shows him to be
'not impregnable as a bulwark of archaism,' as Dr.
Phillips would say." Marjorie was smiling at the
fire, which was only half lighting the corner of the
dim study. "Eleanor, from the moment that I
first heard that man speak and open fire on the
kind of thing the modern girl is going to become, I
marked him for my prey. Oh! it was lovely,"
laughed she suddenly, rocking back and forth in an
ecstasy of delighted amusement, "it was lovely to
see the mighty fall."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do tell me how it happened! What did
you use on the poor man?" asked the eager
Eleanor.</p>

<p>"It wasn't force, hardly even force of argument.
He did not know I was a Bryn Mawrtyr at first,
and so he was led into jesting with me just as he
would have with any mere society girl who was
ready for badinage. When he fathomed my real
character his face was an entertaining spectacle&mdash;a
mixture of regret, astonishment, and&mdash;well,&mdash;annoyance,
such as one is not always privileged to see.
I saw he was preparing for driving me out of college
by hot argument, so I got out my strategic
tools and turned the conversation.</p>

<p>"You know we have threshed this all out before
so many times, and raged to each other about the
quarter of the population who take us, without
looking, for mannish boarding-school girls, as
empty-headed as the women of ten centuries ago,
but more silly because we pretend to be what we
are not; and about the other quarter, who look upon
us as grinds and blue-stockings, star-gazers impossible
and undesirable to touch with a pole of any
length! This man had a smattering of both those
ideas, and was&mdash;is&mdash;bringing up his daughter on
principles impossible to classify. He told me all
about his plans for her before I quite got the conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
turned from the explosive topic, and I
feel sure the poor child will find herself an anachronism
in ten years.</p>

<p>"I knew it would shock him fearfully if I talked
politics; but besides being anxious to shake him up
a bit, I really wanted to do battle with Mr. Atkinson
(as usual) about England's policy in South Africa.
And so I launched on that perilous undertaking,
making as gallant a defence of Oom Paul and all
Boerdom as I knew how. To my huge delight, the
man (his name is Ballantyne) had to acknowledge
that he disagreed with Mr. Atkinson and agreed
with me! Point No. 1.</p>

<p>"Just then Teddy Atkinson began talking music.
You know he is very enthusiastic&mdash;goes to the
Symphony concerts, all the operas, and that sort of
thing. He asked about the Glee Club at college,
and wanted to know if I were still Leading-Grand-High-Soprano-in-Alt,
or something equally foolish.
You should have seen Mr. Ballantyne's face&mdash;looked
as if he thought music and political science mutually
exclusive terms. I plunged in at once and talked
'technical' all I knew how. Don't think me a
horrid <i>poseuse</i>, Lee, though I was playing to the gallery
in a way. I didn't pretend to very much more
than I knew, and besides it was all a part of my
deep-laid plot for bringing down that man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>"You! posing!" was Eleanor's sole comment.
"Go on."</p>

<p>"You see my scheme? To let no subject of
conversation escape; whether it was anything Mr.
Ballantyne had ever heard of or not makes no difference.
The point was to convince him, as thoroughly
as was possible in one short evening, that I,
in the character of college woman, was neither a bit
of thistle-down nor a fearful prig. The next thing
was&mdash;oh yes!&mdash;domestic affairs. Mrs. Atkinson,
without knowing it, helped me immensely there.
She began the topic, and though my knowledge of
it was so theoretical that if I had been an angel I
should have feared to tread on that subject, I rushed
in. Fortunately, I had gathered enough information
from running the house last summer while
mother was away to talk without utter nonsense.
I told them about the cook who said, when I went
down and criticised some of the products of her
skill: 'It's yersilf I'll set on the stove if yez do be
afther interferin' in <i>my</i> bisnis!' And I thought Mr.
Ballantyne's amusement rather excessive for one
who disapproved so heartily of me and my college.
Perhaps he took it as a welcome proof that I
couldn't manage cooks. It proved a good transition
anyway; for Mr. Atkinson was reminded of
one of his delicious stories, which made me think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
of some lovely tales we heard from Betty Hall and
the frivolous-minded Dorothy at the fudge party
after Philosophy exam. on Friday; and then of
course the Ballantyne had one to tell, so that the
table cheered up markedly. I could see now that
he began to think me amusing if peculiar, and I
gained an inch whenever I could.</p>

<p>"After that we went on talking about all sorts of
things, for Teddy Atkinson couldn't have played
better into my hands if he had been an accomplice,
and suggested the most diverse known subjects.
College settlement was closely followed by wireless
telegraphy, yacht races, and golf, especially at the
Merion Cricket Club; and though I had to be wary
of terms sometimes when it came to the second and
third, I didn't back down once&mdash;not once. Then Mr.
Ballantyne and I had a bit of a talk together, in which
I tried to introduce 'a current of new and fresh
ideas' into his mind, and gently remove some
others already there. I think his capitulation would
have come very soon if he had stayed longer, for
when he rose to go he said that he did not know
whether he would find it best for his daughter to
go to Bryn Mawr, but he hoped she would prove
as many-sided as he had found a college woman
might be. Wasn't that worth working hard for?"</p>

<p>Eleanor, leaning over and spanning Marjorie's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
forehead with her hands, murmured "Undue cerebral
enlargement&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lee&mdash;you idiot!" cried Marjorie, "do you imagine
for one moment that I would have spent a
laborious, uncomfortable, self-conscious evening to
make any living person like me on my own account?
I didn't care what Mr. Ballantyne thought
of <i>me</i>&mdash;I wanted to make him like the college girl
in me, and show him how utterly he was mistaken
in his baseless notions of what college makes a
woman."</p>

<p>Marjorie was roused now, and in earnest, and the
light carelessness was gone out of her manner.
Her wide grey eyes, Eleanor could see by the fire-glow,
were shining with an eager light and her
usually pale cheeks were richly flushed. She rose
from the hearth rug, and leaning with one arm
along the mantel, forcefully punctuated her words
by tapping her finger-tips upon it.</p>

<p>"Lee," she said in her clear voice, "we're at a sort
of crisis now, I think&mdash;not the same ring that there
was, well, about twenty years ago, when the question
was, shall women go to college? That has
been answered, and the answer is, yes, because
they <i>will</i>. But now there are quantities of people,
just like Mr. Ballantyne who think the fact that
women will do it adds a most unfortunate complexity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
to modern life; and the burden of proof
that college is the right thing for us lies with us. I
don't mean that we are to claim more for it than it
can do, or pretend to more than we have, but
to be so broad-spirited and alert and interested in
everything, that we shall simply convince these
people that college training is the best thing that
ever happened to women&mdash;especially Bryn Mawr
training. <i>I'm</i> going on a crusade against all infidels
of the genus Ballantyne. Will you go along?"</p>

<p>Eleanor took Marjorie's outstretched hand and
laid her other on her roommate's shoulder. "Of
course I will, Marge, as far as I can. But I'm not
capable like you, and can't do half&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes you are&mdash;yes you can," was Marjorie's confused
answer. And she went on dilating upon
Eleanor's being "a shark at Major English" and
many other delightful things, until that embarrassed
young woman sought a brief respite in a tour of investigation
for the match box, an article of furniture
which seemed bent upon disproving the theory of
the conservation of matter, for it was rarely to be
found. This evening, by some strange chance, it
was discovered on the bookcase, and Eleanor seized
it with alacrity. Just then it was useful to her as a
diversion rather than as a light-producing agent,
but she struck a match from it, lighted a candle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
and handed it to Marjorie, saying, "There, take
that and go to your room. Your hair looks frumpish
with so much excitement, and if you don't
hurry to do it you will be locked out, for the bell
rang ages ago. Think what it would be to miss
Sunday evening supper!"</p>

<p>Marjorie vanished behind the portière and continued
her flow of flattery, which Eleanor by singing
"Ancient of Days," rendered inaudible. Then
they discovered they had but one minute in which
to get to the dining-room, and fled down the corridor
with other late stragglers to reach the goal of
their desires before a dark and cruel hand should
bar them thence.</p>

<p>Marjorie's cause could have found no better
champion, no one more fitted to illustrate her theory
of the influence of college training on women, than
herself. She was one of those healthy inspiring people,
becoming ever more numerous especially among
college women, who do everything well, if not all
things equally well; and who show how invaluable
is the discipline which has given them largeness of
view and a certain ready grasp of affairs often lacking
in those who have missed the same training.
She saw life steadily, this senior of twenty-two,
(though she could not as yet see it whole) and
therefore she was neither scatter-brained nor priggish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
The ideals of balance, proportion, symmetry,
self-control, had been growing clear and attractive
to her all her four years, but they had crystallized
in her thought only in the last.</p>

<p>As she had said to Eleanor, they had "threshed
it all out before," and the occasion of their so doing
had been this:</p>

<p>Marjorie, aspirant for athletic as well as academic
and social success, practiced basket-ball at every
opportunity; and after winning her class numerals
by playing as substitute in a match game in junior
year, was in a fair way to make the senior team.
One rainy November afternoon, Marjorie, in default
of an outdoor game, was throwing and catching
ball in the gymnasium with the senior captain and
a junior. As she ran across the floor after a muffed
ball (which brought down upon her much reviling
by the captain) she noticed a spellbound freshman
standing in the doorway&mdash;a freshman whom she
knew slightly. It was a friend's friend whom Marjorie
had been asked, as upper classmen are every
year, to "look up"; and when she had done so
had found a rather repressive young person, of
serious-minded intent to study, and do nothing else.
When Marjorie saw her "little freshman friend,"
as Eleanor called Marian Coale, with her eyes glued
to the white numerals on Marjorie's dark basket-ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
suit, she nodded to her, and later, when they
all stopped playing, walked off with Marian, as she
had to stop at Radnor Hall, where the latter lived.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you played basket-ball," the
freshman had said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Too awkward?" asked Marjorie with a quizzical
expression in her shining grey eyes. "Or a
weakling&mdash;which?"</p>

<p>The freshman was visibly embarrassed. "I didn't
mean that, you know," she stammered, "but I
didn't think you belonged to the set that cares for&mdash;that
sort of thing." She was gaining confidence
now, and went on somewhat loftily, "It's rather a
waste of time, don't you think? just as so many
teas and plays and things of that sort are. I think
we come here to work." She glanced at the senior
stealthily as she delivered this startling opinion, and
was a little annoyed to find her smiling broadly.</p>

<p>"Of course that's what we come here for," cried
Marjorie, "but you'll find that you do your work
about forty times better if you do something else as
well." Then she had spent a few moments expounding
her views to the serious-minded freshman,
leaving her slightly bewildered and semi-convinced
that there were some things she had not
fathomed in her month of college life.</p>

<p>Marjorie had met before several girls who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
gone through and out of college with similar aims;
but she had not found the type a prevailing one,
for, happily, at Bryn Mawr there exists not only
strong adherence to the high intellectual standard,
but likewise a healthy tendency towards general culture
and breadth of interests. Marian Coale was
one of that minority whose ideal is only knowledge,
not wisdom. She bade fair to become a
bookworm&mdash;of high order, it is true, but yet a
bookworm, and a bookworm, as a factor in life, is,
by common consent, less desirable, admirable, and
useful than a woman.</p>

<p>Marjorie's attack upon her theories, coming as it
did from so well recognized a student, was from
the right quarter, and was well-timed to give the
freshman a new outlook even in her first year. "I
hope I didn't inculcate too much frivolity," said
Marjorie as she was telling Eleanor of this <i>rencontre</i>.
"I tried to make her see that I did not mean quite
being a Jack-at-all-trades, and missing the kernel
of college by running every organization to the exclusion
of lectures. But I toiled to show her that
the opposite sort of mistake is nearly as fatal in the
end. I am hopeful of having her try to make the
Glee Club, and perhaps write for the 'Philistine'!
If she turns out a swan in the literary line shan't I
deserve a vote of thanks from the editorial board?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"You won't get it unless you warn Caroline
Brandes beforehand that 'M. C.' signed to any copy
means Marian Coale as author and Marge Conyngham
as inspirer and motive power," answered
Eleanor in her dry unsmiling way. "What
started you ramping like a lion against the greasy
grinds, Marjorie Daw?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have done it before the end of senior
year anyway, Lee, and probably not then if I had
not come across so very inviting a grind as Marian.
You see she is one of the Coales of Hampstead, who
are friends of the Dorsets, and so I have heard of her
very often. There is so much possibility for all
sorts of fine things in her that I can't bear to see
her shutting everything but one out of her life, even
though that one be books. Be a good friend to
her, Lee, by showing her that even the president of
Self-Government and the next European Fellow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Eleanor's strong hand shut off Marjorie's speech,
for not even by her roommate would she suffer her
chances for carrying off this, the highest of undergraduate
honours, to be discussed. She now informed
Marjorie that if she wished to go on telling
about her schemes for Relieving Socially Indigent
Freshmen, she (Lee) would listen with joy; but approaches
to any other topic would be instantly
punished. And so Marjorie returned to her tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>It was <i>à propos</i> of this episode that Marjorie and
Eleanor had "threshed it all out," as the former said
in discussing Mr. Ballantyne; and during the process
had been half-formed in Marjorie's mind the
idea which, though growing slowly during the long
winter, reached its full maturity only later when
warmed and ripened by that gentleman's noble rage
against women's colleges. Marjorie saw that her
crusade must be carried on both within college and
beyond its peaceful campus. "You see, Eleanor,"
she said, "all the Marian Coales in the freshman
class (I am afraid it is too late to work with hardened
upperclassmen) ought to be given a good
broad point of view on the question of what they
are to get out of college: and <i>then</i> all the Ballantynes
in the world outside are to be convinced that
such a point of view exists&mdash;is more common than
they think. What gives me most hope about the
second half of the work is that the Ballantynes of
the world are nearly always people who have met
no college women, or few and unfortunate specimens
of the race."</p>

<p>With a strong sense of the need of instructing
people of the Coale and the Ballantyne type in the
way they should go, Marjorie began her last Semester
in college. That, however, was only one of a
number of conflicting ideas behind that broad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
white brow of hers. For a senior's last Semester,
by reason of her desire to do her remaining work at
least well enough to merit that coveted title of
Bachelor of Arts, and her intention to spend more
time than she has hitherto spent with the soon-scattered
members of the dear old class, (tramping
with them about the country to the Gulph, Valley
Forge, and the Red Rose Inn, or gathering congenial
spirits about the hospitable chafing-dish)&mdash;by
reason of all this, a senior's second Semester is a
time of great physical activity and some confusion
of mind. Marjorie worked indefatigably at her beloved
political science, took part enthusiastically in
Sheridan's <i>Critic</i> when that delightful drama was
given for the benefit of the College Settlement Chapter,
and when basket-ball training began in mid-March,
cheerfully forswore all sweet things and
"eating between meals," that she might, when the
time came for the inter-class match games, help to
win the silver lantern for the class of &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>And as she worked and played her thoughts were
never far from the crusade she and Eleanor had undertaken.
They told no one of their efforts, but
they were often amused by the way in which their
friends unconsciously forwarded their plans. Carroll
Mayo, dubbed by Marjorie the "Versatile Virginian,"
was a gallant supporter; for though her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
record for scholarship was not so high even as
Marjorie's, it was high enough not to be despised by
the respecters of intellect only, in estimating her
total strength. As for her power in other directions,
Carroll was considered by this somewhat remarkable
group of seniors the best "all round" girl
among them. If Marjorie chanced to have a guest
of the Ballantyne type, (and it must be confessed
that she laid traps for many such by inviting them
to dine or have afternoon tea) she generally contrived
that Carroll should sit on one side of him or
her, and by her unconscious charm help Marjorie
banish the prejudice that was waiting to be
justified.</p>

<p>Then there were Betty Hall and Anne Aldridge,
both of whom were excellent though unconscious
abettors of Marjorie and Lee. Betty, in spite of the
self-distrust that put her into a very real agony of
apprehension whenever examinations stared her in
the face, and caused her to announce beforehand
that in a few short days she would be "flunked
out," was no mean student; and ever since freshman
days of Minor Latin had done clever work in
the classics. She was likewise a good actor of
what she called "heavy female parts," and the
owner of a fund of most delightful stories.</p>

<p>And Anne? Everybody knew Anne. Underclassmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
gazed upon her with awe and rapture&mdash;for
was she not captain of the senior basket-ball
team, whom as juniors she had led to the championship?
Merry, kindly, black-eyed, sweet-tempered,
saucy, loyal, unassuming Anne Aldridge,
overflowing with infectious humour, and having a
good word for every one&mdash;never was any one so
justly popular as she. And to describe her yet further
with a wild flight of far-fetched metaphor, she
was one of the brightest jewels in the crown of the
biology professor!</p>

<p>Less considerable than the help given the two
crusaders by these three was that which Marjorie
and Eleanor received from another unwitting
senior&mdash;Kate Murray. Kate, if she had not been
thrown with such girls as Marjorie, Eleanor, and
her own roommate, Dorothy Van Dyke, might
have turned out pure grind; but the constant contact
with the good friends had bred in her a wholesome
sense of the value of a well-rounded college
experience. Now, in senior year, although she had
at times to be forcibly dragged from work by the
frivolous Dorothy, she was heard to deliver herself
spontaneously of the opinion that people ought to
play daily,&mdash;afternoon tea with the six, after a long
tramp or basket-ball being preferred as the form
that play was to take. And so when outside influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
was used to make Kate take her own
advice, she was an admirable example to the delinquent
freshman Coale.</p>

<p>That clever young person whom Marjorie had
found so problematical, was now, by the end of the
second Semester, working herself out to a satisfactory
solution. The slight change which had
already, under the energetic training of Marjorie,
taken place in her was remarked by many who had
known her in her freshest freshman days, even
though they did not know of the influence that had
wrought it. She was more alert, more sympathetic
than she had been when first the senior started her
upon a course not laid down in the college program;
but not being of an introspective nature, she
was hardly conscious of the utter difference between
her former and her present points of view.</p>

<p>Her attitude towards the question of the next
European Fellow, (that annual earthquake whose
rumblings so agitate the entire college with increasing
violence until the shock of the final announcement
rends it) was a delightful index to Marjorie
of her own success in crusading, and of what she
considered Marian's improved mental condition resulting
therefrom. They talked it over, as do any
two Bryn Mawr girls who are together for more
than five minutes at this period of the year; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Marian, somewhat diffidently because she was a
freshman talking of seniors, said she very much
hoped that Carroll Mayo would be the choice of the
Faculty. Why? Oh, because she was the sort of
person the college might for every reason be proud
to have represent it at a foreign university.</p>

<p>Didn't she think other people were as promising
candidates? Marjorie had inquired. Oh, yes, but personally
she wanted to see a girl as charming and as
"all-round" as Carroll win. She thought Eleanor
Mertoun another great person for the honour,&mdash;supposed
Kate Murray had a show, but she wasn't very
enthusiastic about <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the senior class, with the best
possible right, was in a state of ferment that was
not to be relieved save by the knowledge of which
one of them was chosen for such well-nigh crushing
honour. As March advanced, all other topics of
conversation at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, during
long walks, or strolls about the campus on the way
to lectures, or from the athletic field, were relegated
to the forgotten corners of the mental attic; and
"who do <i>you</i> think will have the fellowship?"
was the incessant question.</p>

<p>When the bulletin boards at last displayed the
announcement that all the students were requested
to come to chapel on Tuesday morning, March 20th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
like a leaping prairie fire spread the news that the
European Fellow's name was to be made public.
At once discussion waxed the more violent, that
every one might say all she thought before the
need for speculation in regard to the chosen one
should be past. Monday afternoon, when the
final Faculty meeting for deciding the matter was in
progress, was spent by the senior class in a state of
restlessness that kept them vibrating in a distracted
manner between that portion of the campus immediately
under the windows of the President's
office (as though forsooth any information could
trickle, like a welcome stream, down to the thirsty
ones below) and the rooms of different members of
the class who were so fortunate as to live facing
that august building where the fate of several people
was being decided. Pembroke East, being
nearest Taylor was the favourite place for these indoor
gatherings, and Marjorie's and Eleanor's study,
which faced the President's office windows, was
filled with a constantly changing crowd of eager
seniors. In the course of the afternoon, practically
every one in the class was suggested; for human
nature, in such cases, does not thoroughly like being
surprised, and there was abroad a hardly culpable
longing to be able to say, "I told you so," in
case some dark horse should prove the winner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
When the Faculty meeting was over, they knew
would come, in some mysterious manner, the
official notice from the Secretary of the Faculty to
the chosen candidate. Then, in accordance with a
wise provision which prevents the spontaneous
combustion of the new-made fellow, she might tell
one of her friends. And every one longed to be
sharer in the secret that was to be kept over-night.</p>

<p>As it happens every year, so too when the class
of &mdash;&mdash; were seniors, the efforts at discovering the
recipient of the Faculty note failed utterly, and
all but two seniors were therefore ignorant of the
long-desired name when the morning came on
which the public announcement was to be made.
Speculation was rife, and breakfast, contrary to its
usual sleepy moroseness, was nearly as animated
and "discussive" (Marjorie's word) as dinner was
prone to be.</p>

<p>At last Taylor bell begins to ring for chapel, and
hardly has the first stroke melted into the clanging
monotone of the succeeding ones when on all sides
is displayed an unwonted eagerness for attending
divine service (not compulsory). From every hall
flow long lines of students, the black gowns of the
more eager ones streaming straight out behind them
in the fresh March wind, like Alice's hair when the
Red Queen ran with her "faster! faster!" Followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
by the slower comers, they hurry into
Taylor, up the staircase and into the chapel. There
they scatter to the excited though somewhat subdued
groups that occupy the sections set apart by
unwritten law for different classes. In the middle
front writhes the senior class, forgetful of its usual
stony impassiveness in the face of anxiety. They
are excited, for is it not one of themselves that has
been chosen? They are supported on the left by
the loyal juniors, who, because they have known
the Fellow (whoever she may be) three years,
longer than any other class in college, are in turn
justly thrilled. The right flank is held by the
devoted sophomore class, excited because those
from among whom the Fellow comes were
once their champions, when in freshman year
they needed such. And behind the choir, which is
the rearguard of the seniors, sit the freshmen, excited
because they have never before come within
hailing distance of the honour.</p>

<p>The clock is anxiously watched as the hands approach,
oh! so slowly, towards 8:45. Every probable,
nay possible, candidate is being pierced to the
soul from all sides with glances compared to which
a hawk's would be careless and cursory. Now
and again the wave of whispering and laughter
rises suddenly, until some conscience-pricked proctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
silences the throng. It begins again&mdash;a low bubbling
noise that is alive with anxious, suppressed
excitement, and that threatens to engulf the
decorous Chapel in the rise of its un-religious tide.</p>

<p>The nervous twisting about to survey the crowd,
the buzz of talk, the ripple of laughter, cease suddenly.
Then as the President and the College
Preacher, in their academic robes, enter the two
upper doors and ascend the platform, the mass
rises, and led by the choir breaks into a vigorous
processional hymn. Then very quiet is the room
while the words of the strong King David are read,
and it is only when the last sentence of the prayer
brings the students upright that the excitement
breaks forth again.</p>

<p>Across the rustle of readjustment, subduing it
momentarily as a great wind flattens the waves for
an instant only to toss them the more wildly, comes
the voice of the President.</p>

<p>"Before we come to speak of the purpose for
which we are gathered here this morning," she begins,
her smile expressing perfect appreciation of
the suspense that racks her audience, "I should like
to make some announcements of general interest to
the students." The strained attention of her hearers
all over the Chapel breaks in hardly audible catches
of the breath. Those unheard announcements give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
time for further speculation as to the candidate.
Marjorie is eagerly leaning forward, too impatient-looking
for one who knows the Thing&mdash;so it can't
be Eleanor, decide the sagest critics. Kate Murray
is abnormally flushed, Carroll correspondingly
pale. It must be Carroll&mdash;she looks so subdued&mdash;so
unexcited.</p>

<p>Those announcements are over. The President
unfolds an innocent-looking bit of paper. The
honour list of ten, from whom the Fellow has been
chosen, is read. "Is it she?" is the tacit question
of the crowd at each name. Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"The decision has been difficult," says the President
impressively. "After long and earnest discussion
the Faculty has nominated to the Board of
Trustees, as European Fellow for the coming
year&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A pause. The weighted silence seems to stifle
one.</p>

<p>"Eleanor Whitcomb Mertoun!"</p>

<p>A roar shatters the air&mdash;or is it the roof?&mdash;a shout
of generous gladness mingled with the hearty
clamour of hand and heel. The pent-up eagerness
to know is changed into the longing to honour the
chosen candidate, and it bursts forth and swirls
tumultuously about Eleanor like the Fundy tide. It
rises, falls, rises again, twenty feet at a leap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>Marjorie is meantime pounding Eleanor's knee,
and exclaiming to every one within reach, "I knew
it! I knew it!" as though some especial credit
were due her for having been told the secret. Kate
Murray, on the other side, was dragging Eleanor
down by the neck, as if she would unseat from its
firm base the head whose market value had risen
100% in five minutes.</p>

<p>Decorum returns for a moment when the President
dismisses the students with the request that
they sing the college hymn; and they sing it as can
only those that have felt the "gracious inspiration"
of our "Mistress and Mother." When it is over,
there is a rush for Lee Mertoun from all sides, for it
is <i>de rigueur</i> to shake the new Fellow's hand very
nearly to the maiming of that revered member. For
ten minutes she clasps hands, hardly recognizing
their owners in the press; and then gradually, as the
bell rings for first lectures, the crowd melts out of
the chapel.</p>

<p>As Lee, Marjorie, Kate, and Carroll left the room
Marjorie ran her arm through that of the warm and
red recipient of blushing honours and facing her
quickly about, pointed tragically with her pen at
the almost deserted confusion of chairs helplessly
awry.</p>

<p>"There, woman," she said, "a picture of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
might with great plausibility be labelled 'Charleston
after the Earthquake.' That is all your fault, and it
is what you have got to live up to."</p>

<p>Eleanor laughed. "If that were all!" she said.</p>

<p>"You are right&mdash;there is more," retorted Marjorie,
putting her own construction upon Eleanor's
words. "You have to live this thing down as well
as live up to it. And that means you will have to
work hard to convince the infidels that you are still
in the crusade, and that you stand for something besides
the midnight oil. Now if you have yourself
well in hand after all this agitation, let's go to
Latin." So the four seniors wended their way
through the small groups that were still "talking it
over," Marjorie declaring that she simply must cut
her own lecture and go with Lee to Major Latin, in
order to see how to treat a Fellow.</p>

<p>As they passed into Room E closing the door behind
them with the peculiarly irritating, undecided
rattle that particular door always gives, suspended
animation woke again in the lingering underclassmen,
who had ceased their talk to gaze after the
person who had suddenly become a Personage in
the college world. A knot of freshmen talked in
low tones.</p>

<p>"Marian Coale is embittered for life because Marjorie
didn't get it," suggested one teasingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not," protested the literal-minded accused.
"Marjorie doesn't deserve it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, how disloyal!" murmured the tease.</p>

<p>"&mdash;so far as scholarship is concerned," she finished.</p>

<p>"What else would you base the choice upon?"
was the astonished inquiry from another.</p>

<p>"That is the first thing to consider, of course;
but it is not all." And Marian waxed eloquent
upon the subject of the ideal European Fellow.</p>

<p>"Who told you all this?" asked she of the insatiable
desire to annoy, when Marian paused.
"You didn't have it with you when you came to
college."</p>

<p>Marian's dark face reddened. "I am learning a
few things in college," was the slow answer.
"One is to value something beside pure intellect,
and to estimate people at more than the amount of
grey matter they happen to possess."</p>

<p>This was quite true. Marian's face-about was a
matter of great astonishment to the few who had
known her at all well when she entered. Most of
them traced the change to her friendship with Marjorie,
but no one, least of all Marian herself, suspected
that design on the part of the senior had
brought it about.</p>

<p>As to Marjorie, she hardly believed in the transformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
of the freshman, and kept furtively
watching her convert for some signs of flagging
energy. But watch as she might she never saw in
Marian any indications of departure from the way
into which she had been drawn. As the spring
advanced, and one was greeted upon going out of
doors with the faint, exhilarating scent of new-sprung
grass, and the sight of a green patch, like
the broadcast promise of the prodigal summer,
here and there on the brown campus, Marjorie began
to feel that the first part of the "crusade" she
had placed before herself that February day had
been carried out.</p>

<p>The second part, which concerned the extra-college
world of men and women she had in the meantime
not neglected. Here, her efforts, though not
confined to Mr. Ballantyne, were yet centred in
him. She dated her spring, as do most Bryn
Mawrtyrs, by the changes in field and tree, but in
this particular year she counted time also by her
progress with the "genus Ballantyne," and especially
with him from whom it took its name. In
the time of cherry blossoms, when the black old
trunks flung over them a white splendour woven by
the wind and the sun, she had broken through the
outer wall of prejudice that had been so weakened
by her first attack. When the wind began to whirl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
from the apple-trees the full-blown petals, she felt
that she was actually gaining ground, and faster
than she had hoped; and when finally the daisies
whitened the country-side, Marjorie received proof
of complete triumph.</p>

<p>This pleasant reward for the labour of a Semester
came to Marjorie one Saturday afternoon in the latter
half of May. The days had been warm and, as
the work piled up in its inevitable way towards the
end of the year, wearisome also. Dorothy Van
Dyke, to celebrate the passing of the week, persuaded
Kate Murray that they two should give a
"Ball" to the other five under the big cherry-tree
by Pembroke West. So it came about that lemonade
flowed freely there that afternoon, and every
one of the seven friends returning from a shopping
expedition in town, from work, or what not, was
welcomed to rugs, cushions and the cool clink of
ice under the hospitable boughs. Marjorie was
there, of course, helping every one in her own particularly
helpful way. It was restful, sitting there
in the golden-green afternoon shadows, while the
breath of the lilacs drifted along to them with the
lazy air. The beauty of it all silenced the little
group more than once, and their love for campus
and halls rose breast-high&mdash;throat-high, and choked
them oddly as they thought of going away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>Dear grey, ivy-clad halls! curtained in April with
rich, tender green that is pierced to the heart with
glorious sunlight, and that undulates, rippling, in
the sweet spring wind; reddened by your vines that
burn, lit by the sunset, in October; standing bare,
proudly silent when the shouting north wind whirls
the white snow about you; roofed with silver when
the high moon dapples the grey road with the soft
dim shadows of your trees; stately but never cold,
always beautiful and beloved; if you but set upon
your children as they go forth from you (groping
their way because their eyes are clouded) your hallmarks
of strong intellect, high honour, broad sympathy,
and quick insight&mdash;who of all <i>Almæ Matres</i>
may more truly rejoice in her noble race than Bryn
Mawr?</p>

<p>A mood of contemplation could not but soon
pass with such a group. The irrepressible Dorothy
shattered it now.</p>

<p>"Here's a man coming up the walk," she announced.
"Does he belong to any of you? Daughter is with him."</p>

<p>Every one turned to see if he "belonged" to her,
and Marjorie seized Lee's arm as she recognized the
stately figure.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ballantyne&mdash;and Louise. What do you
think that means, Lee?"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose you go to find out," suggested Eleanor.
"He probably wants to see you at all events."
And Marjorie went.</p>

<p>When she came back half an hour later, after
showing the delighted father and daughter as
much about college as was possible at that unpropitious
time of day, her face was glowing with
pleasure.</p>

<p>"Marge," called Dorothy, as she came running
across the grass from where she had been speeding
the parting guests, "we've decided to cut dinner
and stay out here until it's time for the Glee Club to
sing on the steps."</p>

<p>"Jolly," answered Marjorie, "who cares for dinner
anyway?" She dropped down beside Eleanor
and seized her firmly by the shoulder. "Lee Mertoun,
Mr. Ballantyne brought Louise out to see her
future Alma Mater. She goes to Miss Stevens's
school next fall for the last two years of prep.
work&mdash;then here to college. <i>Was denkst du?</i>"</p>

<p>Eleanor clapped her hands delightedly. "Good
work, Marge! I knew it would come about. Why,
at this rate there won't be any of the genus left in
the city of Philadelphia&mdash;not an infidel to crusade
on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Betty Hall's voice broke across the stream of congratulation.
"Of course, Carroll, I wouldn't mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
it to her, but I think it shows just a <i>little</i> lack
of breeding to discuss something we know nothing
about!"</p>

<p>The laugh that followed this expansive hint was
joined in by Marjorie and Lee.</p>

<p>"Do tell them about the crusade, Marjorie. It is
time now, I think, especially as you have met the
enemy and made him yours, poetically speaking.
You don't know how I have been burdened by this
ghastly secret!"</p>

<p>And while the sun sank and the shadows melted
into the one deepening shadow we call twilight,
and the circling bats flickered against the sky, Marjorie
told of the problem that had presented itself to
her that winter, and of her plans and efforts for its
solution.</p>

<p>"Of course," she finished, "I don't mean to have
it take all my time. There are other things more
important, and besides it is not the sort of thing
that can be done by constant conscious effort. But
it seems to me so very well worth while to convince
people at large of the value of college training,
that I am willing to go out of my way sometimes to
do it. And if we <i>are</i> going to do it, we have got
to take care that we are broad and sympathetic,
and not merely 'cold, learned, dehumanized'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>By senior year one's friends never let one's statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
go unchallenged. Kate Murray as might
have been expected, now took up the case for a
hypothetical defendant.</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you at all, Marjorie. That's
a one-sided way of looking at the matter. You
leave out of account, absolutely, the point of view
of the people who devote their lives to one particular
side of intellectual work, and accomplish the
greatest masterpieces of the world. Specialization
is the only thing that brings about great results in
many cases; and where would be the great works
that are above the horrible level of mediocrity, if
your doctrine of&mdash;of&mdash;universal versatility (stop
giggling. I'm not trying to be poetic or funny
either) were accepted by everybody?"</p>

<p>"See here, Kate," broke in Carroll, "it's you that
are getting one-sided now. I see what Marjorie is
after and I think she is quite right. Getting bloodless
and thin-lipped <i>is</i> one of the dangers of the
college woman."</p>

<p>Anne Aldridge's quick voice answered Carroll.</p>

<p>"That's all very well for the world at large, Carroll,
but I think Kate has made a very good point in
bringing up the case of the great minds of the
world. I believe that genius is 'an unlimited capacity
for hard work' in more cases than you think.
Now if people who have power of that sort should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
let themselves be turned aside by a desire to be
open to impressions from all sides, the world would
certainly be the loser by it. I haven't genius even
of the hard work description, and so I shall never
deny myself the pleasure of as much of your society
as I can get, merely to go on pegging away at the
regeneration of the pharynx of the earthworm! But
if anybody has the power of doing something really
great, for the world's sake, don't preach versatility
to that person. There are few enough of us that
can add to the sum of knowledge."</p>

<p>"That's a part of what I mean, Anne," struck in
Marjorie eagerly. "There are few of us that can
do that, but there are quantities of people who will
never be able to do more than grind, and who yet
abstract themselves from the world of actual life as
though they were hermit geniuses. I say they have
no right to do it, and that they owe as much to
their fellows as to their own brains. Don't you see
that the existence of such people among us is what
gives people like Mr. Ballantyne their opportunity
to misjudge the college woman? I've thought a
good deal about both sides of this, and I think I
have good grounds for carrying on what Lee and I
have called, rather as a joke, our crusade. Please
don't misunderstand me to mean that the women
of really great intellectual power are to let their remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
work be interfered with by turning that
power aside to every little thing."</p>

<p>"So far as we ourselves are concerned," said
Kate, "I think we may agree with you, Marjorie;
for probably none of us is a genius except our
European Fellow&mdash;of course she is. And so if we
may be allowed to let alone all those bearing the
marks of genius, we may join the crusade too. I
am willing anyway to help in the attack on the large
and flourishing Ballantyne species, and convince it
that not all college women consist solely of massive
intellect."</p>

<p>"And I too," said Anne.</p>

<p>"So am I," came from each of the others.</p>

<p>"Good children," said Marjorie gaily, as she
threw an arm across the shoulders of Anne and of
Kate, on either side of her. It was all she said but
her satisfaction was deep.</p>

<p>Silence fell among them as it will when good
friends sit together. A late robin-song floated over
to them from the apple-trees. The evening star,
like a sanctuary lamp, swung above the dying
altar-fire of the sunset. The cool, nameless fragrance
of a spring night filled the air. There under
the old cherry-tree sat the seven with no word,
until at last the silence was broken by snatches of
melody, vague talking, and the laughter from strolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
groups. Then, drawn back from their dreaming,
they rose and went away to join the singing on
the senior steps.</p>
